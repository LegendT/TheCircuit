## Decision Science Foundations

### The Convergent Evidence: Seven Disciplines, One Conclusion

Across decision science, behavioural economics, cognitive psychology, and organisational behaviour, research converges on a single finding with direct implications for constrained decision environments: **structure, constraint, and forced commitment produce better decision outcomes than unrestricted choice, unlimited information, and reversible decisions.**

This is not a marginal finding from a single study. It is the throughline connecting seven decades of Nobel Prize-winning research across multiple disciplines. Each major branch of decision science provides independent evidence that the circuit's design principles — constraint, sufficiency boundaries, forced commitment, and structured artefact production — are grounded in established science.

### Theory 1: Bounded Rationality and Satisficing (Herbert Simon, 1956)

**The foundational theory: humans are not optimisers. They are satisficers.**

Herbert Simon introduced the concept of "satisficing" — a portmanteau of "satisfy" and "suffice" — in 1956 to describe how humans actually make decisions. Rather than evaluating all possible alternatives to find the optimal choice (which is computationally impossible for most real decisions), people search until they find an option that meets their minimum threshold of acceptability, then stop.

Simon's insight was not that satisficing is a cognitive limitation to overcome — it is an adaptive strategy that often outperforms optimisation. In his Nobel Prize in Economics speech, Simon observed: "Decision makers can satisfice either by finding optimum solutions for a simplified world, or by finding satisfactory solutions for a more realistic world. Neither approach, in general, dominates the other."

Crucially, specific satisficing strategies for inference have been shown to be *ecologically rational* — in particular decision environments, they outperform alternatives that use more information and more computation.

**Circuit design implication:** The sufficiency boundary — the circuit's mechanism for declaring "this is enough" — is not a shortcut or a compromise. It is the implementation of an empirically validated decision strategy. The circuit does not ask "have you found the best option?" It asks "have you found a sufficient option and can you commit?" This is satisficing operationalised as a product feature.

### Theory 2: The Less-Is-More Effect (Gerd Gigerenzer)

**Counterintuitive finding: simple decision rules using less information frequently outperform complex analyses using more information.**

Gerd Gigerenzer and the Max Planck Institute's ABC Research Group demonstrated through computer simulations and experiments that "fast and frugal" heuristics — decision strategies that deliberately ignore information — can match or exceed the accuracy of complex statistical models. This is the "less-is-more effect": using fewer cues, fewer variables, and simpler decision rules produces better outcomes in many real-world environments.

The most striking example: a simple 3-step yes/no checklist outperforms a 19-point statistical analysis for determining which heart attack patients should be classified as high risk. Three constrained decisions, completed quickly, diagnose more accurately than an unconstrained analysis of all available data.

Gigerenzer's framework identifies an "adaptive toolbox" of heuristics that exploit the structure of the environment. The key insight: heuristic accuracy depends not on having more information but on matching the decision strategy to the environment's structure. In uncertain, time-pressured environments — precisely where the circuit's gap buyer operates — fast and frugal strategies dominate.

**Circuit design implication:** The 5-move circuit is a fast-and-frugal heuristic operationalised as a product. It deliberately constrains information processing to a structured sequence. It does not ask the user to consider everything — it asks the user to consider five specific things in a specific order. Gigerenzer's research provides direct evidence that this constraint improves, rather than degrades, decision quality.

### Theory 3: The Paradox of Choice and Choice Overload (Iyengar & Lepper, Schwartz)

**Landmark finding: more options do not produce better decisions. They produce paralysis, dissatisfaction, and regret.**

In 2000, Sheena Iyengar and Mark Lepper conducted the now-famous "jam study" — a supermarket experiment comparing consumer behaviour when offered 24 jam varieties versus 6. The larger display attracted more browsers, but the smaller display produced dramatically more purchases: 40% conversion with 6 options versus 3% with 24. Buyers who chose from fewer options also reported greater satisfaction with their selection.

Barry Schwartz formalised this as the "Paradox of Choice": while some choice is better than none, more choice is not always better than less. Each additional option increases decision-making complexity, potentially causing anxiety, regret, and inflated expectations. The same effect has been replicated across domains — from chocolates to university essay assignments, where students wrote better essays when given fewer topics to choose from.

**Circuit design implication:** The circuit's constraint design is a direct application of choice overload research. By limiting the decision environment to 5 structured moves — rather than an open-ended analysis space — the circuit reduces the option set to a manageable size. The circuit does not offer 24 ways to approach a decision. It offers one: the 5-move sequence. This is the jam study applied to professional decision-making.

### Theory 4: Dual Process Theory and System 2 Activation (Kahneman)

**Framework: professional decision quality depends on activating deliberate reasoning when intuition alone is insufficient.**

Daniel Kahneman's dual-process theory distinguishes between System 1 (fast, automatic, intuitive) and System 2 (slow, deliberate, analytical). System 1 handles most daily decisions effortlessly, but it is vulnerable to cognitive biases, anchoring effects, and pattern-matching errors. System 2 is more accurate for complex decisions but requires effort, structure, and activation — it does not engage spontaneously.

In professional settings, experienced practitioners develop accurate "gut feelings" (System 1) through years of practice, but they must systematically verify these through structured analysis (System 2) to prevent diagnostic errors. Medical professionals, for example, must balance quick diagnostic intuitions with careful analytical thinking. The key finding: System 2 engagement requires *environmental triggers* — structured processes, forced reflection, and deliberate constraints that interrupt automatic thinking.

Nudges — low-cost, gentle interventions that influence behaviour by making it easier to make good decisions — work by activating System 2 without forbidding System 1. The circuit is a more active version of this: it creates a structured environment that forces System 2 engagement through its sequential constraint design.

**Circuit design implication:** Each move in the circuit is a System 2 activation trigger. The Orientation move forces the user to articulate what they're actually deciding (interrupting System 1's assumption that "I already know what I'm deciding"). The Eligibility move forces explicit criteria definition. The Declaration move forces commitment. The Sufficiency move forces the "enough" declaration. Each move is a structured intervention that prevents System 1 from short-circuiting the process.

### Theory 5: Decision Noise and Decision Hygiene (Kahneman, Sibony, Sunstein)

**Critical finding: the biggest source of decision error is not bias — it is noise. Structured processes reduce noise dramatically.**

In *Noise: A Flaw in Human Judgment* (2021), Kahneman, Sibony, and Sunstein demonstrated that "noise" — undesirable variability in judgments that should be identical — is a pervasive and largely invisible source of decision error. Their most striking example: insurance underwriters at the same company, given the same five fictional customers, set median premiums that varied by 55% — five times more than expected by executives.

Noise exists in every domain where humans make judgments: sentencing decisions, medical diagnoses, hiring decisions, financial assessments. The authors found that noise often constitutes the *larger* part of total error, making noise reduction "the easiest way to realise large reductions in error."

Their solution is **decision hygiene** — a set of structural techniques that reduce noise without needing to identify every specific cause:
- Structure and break down judgments into several independent components
- Resist premature overall intuitions
- Use clearly defined criteria and relative scales
- Collect and evaluate evidence before forming a holistic judgment
- Use the **Mediating Assessments Protocol**: evaluate individual attributes independently, then combine

The authors found that structured interviews — with clear questions, defined scoring, and evaluations across key traits — are not only more consistent but also more accurate than unstructured ones. The same principle applies to any judgment task.

**Circuit design implication:** The 5-move circuit IS a decision hygiene protocol. It structures the decision into independent components (Orientation, Eligibility, Declaration, Sufficiency, Artefact). It resists premature intuitions by forcing sequential evaluation. It uses defined criteria at each stage. The Calibration Capture is a post-decision noise audit — capturing the decision-maker's self-assessment against structured dimensions. The entire circuit design maps directly to Kahneman's decision hygiene principles.

### Theory 6: Choice Architecture and Environmental Design (Thaler & Sunstein)

**Principle: the structure of the decision environment shapes the quality of the decision. Design the environment, and you design the outcome.**

Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein coined "choice architecture" in their 2008 book *Nudge* to describe the practice of influencing choice by "organising the context in which people make decisions." Their central claim: there is no neutral way to present a choice. Every decision environment has an architecture — defaults, framing, sequencing, information presentation — that shapes behaviour whether designed intentionally or not.

Their approach, which they termed "libertarian paternalism," uses structural design to nudge individuals toward better choices without forbidding options or significantly changing economic incentives. Key tools include: defaults (what happens if you do nothing), expecting error (designing for human fallibility), structuring complex choices (breaking them into manageable parts), and giving feedback (making the consequences of choices visible).

The UK's Behavioural Insights Team ("Nudge Unit") and the White House's equivalent demonstrate that choice architecture has moved from academic theory to government policy. The principle is now mainstream: **how you structure the environment determines the quality of decisions made within it.**

**Circuit design implication:** The circuit is not a tool within an existing decision environment. It IS a decision environment — designed from first principles as a choice architecture. The 5-move sequence is the structure. The sufficiency boundary is the default ("you must declare sufficiency to proceed"). The artefact is the feedback mechanism (making the decision's logic visible). The token model is the commitment mechanism. Every element of the circuit maps to a choice architecture principle.

### Theory 7: Commitment Devices and the Irreversibility Effect

**Two converging findings: (1) self-imposed constraints improve follow-through, and (2) irreversible decisions produce greater satisfaction than reversible ones.**

**Commitment devices** are voluntary strategies that introduce costs to your current self to bring about gains for your future self. They work because humans suffer from a discrepancy between short-term and long-term preferences — we know what we should do but struggle to do it. Research demonstrates concrete improvements: commitment contracts significantly improved attendance (p = 0.05) and completion rates (p = 0.032) in weight management programmes. A hotel field experiment found 25% greater towel reuse among guests who made a commitment at check-in.

The greater the cost of breaking a commitment, the more effective it is. Individuals are motivated to maintain a consistent self-image and will keep commitments to avoid reputational damage (if public) and cognitive dissonance (if private).

**The irreversibility effect** adds a second dimension: research published in *Psychology Research and Behavior Management* (2022) found that reversible decisions have a significant negative impact on satisfaction compared to irreversible decisions. Why? Irreversible decisions trigger the "psychological immune system" — people optimise their feelings about an outcome once they understand it cannot be changed. Reversible decisions, by contrast, direct attention toward the negative aspects of chosen alternatives and positive aspects of rejected ones, decreasing satisfaction.

Critically, satisficers — people who seek "good enough" rather than "best" — were more satisfied following irreversible decisions, while maximisers preferred reversibility. The circuit's target user (the Decision Owner) is a satisficer by definition: someone who needs to stop analysing and commit.

**Circuit design implication:** The circuit is a commitment device. The token purchase is the entry commitment (money spent cannot be recovered). Each move is a progressive commitment that narrows the decision space. The artefact is the irreversible output — once produced, it documents what was decided and cannot be undone. The entire design leverages both commitment device theory and the irreversibility effect to produce higher satisfaction and stronger ownership.

### Theory 8: Cognitive Load Theory and Decision Degradation

**Established finding: high cognitive load systematically degrades decision quality. Reducing cognitive load improves outcomes.**

Cognitive Load Theory, developed by John Sweller, establishes that working memory has finite capacity. When cognitive load exceeds capacity — through too many options, too much information, or too many simultaneous demands — decision-making quality degrades systematically: heightened dependence on simplistic heuristics and cognitive biases, reduced attention to critical details, and impaired logical reasoning and self-regulation.

Research from the Global Council for Behavioral Science confirms: high cognitive load depletes working memory, forcing systematic degradation in decision-making quality. When overwhelmed with information or choices, individuals resort to rules of thumb that produce sub-optimal outcomes.

The practical implication has been validated across domains: to improve decision quality, reduce cognitive load by minimising the number of choices, offering clear and concise information, and guiding people through the decision-making process.

**Circuit design implication:** The circuit reduces cognitive load through three mechanisms: (1) it limits the decision to 5 structured moves rather than an open-ended process; (2) each move has a single clear purpose rather than multiple simultaneous demands; (3) the sequential design means the user only needs to hold one move's requirements in working memory at a time. The circuit does not ask the user to think about everything simultaneously — it asks them to think about one thing at a time, in order.

### Synthesis: The Scientific Case for Constrained Decision Environments

The eight theories above are not isolated findings. They form a convergent body of evidence — spanning Nobel Prize-winning economics, cognitive psychology, behavioural science, and medical decision-making — that points to a single conclusion:

**Constraint is not a limitation on decision quality. It is a prerequisite for it.**

| Theory | Key Finding | Circuit Feature It Validates |
|--------|------------|----------------------------|
| Bounded Rationality (Simon) | Satisficing outperforms optimising in realistic environments | Sufficiency boundary |
| Less-Is-More Effect (Gigerenzer) | Fewer cues and simpler rules produce more accurate decisions | 5-move constraint (not unlimited analysis) |
| Paradox of Choice (Iyengar, Schwartz) | Fewer options → better decisions, higher satisfaction | Structured sequence (not open-ended) |
| Dual Process Theory (Kahneman) | System 2 requires environmental triggers to engage | Each move is a System 2 activation trigger |
| Decision Noise (Kahneman et al.) | Structured processes reduce noise and total error | Circuit = decision hygiene protocol |
| Choice Architecture (Thaler & Sunstein) | Environment design shapes decision quality | Circuit IS a designed decision environment |
| Commitment Devices + Irreversibility | Constraint and irreversibility improve follow-through and satisfaction | Token model + progressive commitment + artefact |
| Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller) | Reducing cognitive load improves decision quality | Sequential single-focus moves |

**No existing professional decision tool is designed around these principles.** Enterprise platforms add data (increasing cognitive load). Consumer apps offer comparison (feeding the paradox of choice). Analytical instruments provide frameworks (but not constraint). The circuit is the first product to apply the full weight of decision science's convergent evidence to a constrained professional environment.

The scientific foundation is not a marketing claim. It is the product's architecture.

## Constrained Environment Precedents

### The Pattern That Already Works: Four Professions, One Design Principle

The circuit is not proposing something new. It is applying something that already works — in the highest-stakes professional environments on earth.

Medicine, aviation, military operations, and law have each independently discovered the same principle: **when the consequences of a decision are severe and irreversible, you do not give the decision-maker more freedom. You give them more structure.** Surgeons do not improvise. Pilots do not freelance. Military commanders do not wing it. Judges do not decide by feel.

Each of these professions has developed constrained decision environments — structured protocols that force practitioners through defined sequences, require explicit declarations at each stage, and produce documented artefacts of the decision process. These are not training wheels for novices. They are professional instruments used by the most experienced practitioners precisely because experience alone is insufficient.

The circuit's design draws directly from these precedents. What follows is not analogy — it is pattern extraction from four decades of evidence.

### Precedent 1: Medicine — The Checklist Revolution

**The origin story: a 19-item checklist cut surgical deaths by 47%.**

In 2009, Atul Gawande and a WHO research team published results in the *New England Journal of Medicine* that transformed surgical practice worldwide. A 19-item surgical safety checklist — tested across 7,688 patients in eight countries, from Tanzania to Toronto — reduced major surgical complications from 11% to 7% (a one-third reduction) and inpatient deaths from 1.5% to 0.8% (a 47% reduction). The reductions were of equal magnitude in high-income and lower-income settings.

The checklist was structured around three critical junctures: **Sign In** (before anaesthesia induction), **Time Out** (immediately before skin incision), and **Sign Out** (before the patient leaves the operating room). Each juncture required explicit verbal confirmation from the surgical team — a forced declaration that specific conditions had been met before proceeding.

Gawande's insight, documented in *The Checklist Manifesto* (2009), was not that surgeons lacked skill. It was that modern surgery had become too complex for any individual — however skilled — to get everything right from memory alone. The checklist was not a crutch for incompetence. It was a constraint that made competence reliable.

**The broader pattern in medicine:**

- **Clinical protocols** standardise diagnosis and treatment sequences, reducing variability and improving outcomes across practitioners
- **Diagnostic checklists** have been shown to reduce diagnostic error by ensuring differential diagnoses are systematically considered rather than intuitively dismissed
- **Structured Professional Judgment (SPJ)** in forensic psychology uses procedural checklists and empirical guidelines for risk assessment — studies show SPJ-based risk ratings are more accurate than unstructured clinical judgments
- **Clinical decision support systems** embed evidence-based constraints directly into the clinical workflow, guiding practitioners through structured decision pathways

The evidence is unambiguous: in medicine, constraint saves lives. Not because doctors are careless, but because human cognition is fallible, and structured environments compensate for that fallibility.

**Circuit design implication:** The circuit's 5-move sequence is a professional checklist applied to business decisions. Like the WHO surgical safety checklist, it structures the decision around critical junctures (Orientation, Eligibility, Declaration, Sufficiency, Artefact). Like medical protocols, it requires explicit confirmation at each stage before proceeding. Like SPJ, it replaces unstructured judgment with structured professional assessment. The circuit does not assume its users are incompetent — it assumes they are human.

### Precedent 2: Aviation — Structured Decision-Making Under Pressure

**The origin story: a plane was "too complex to fly." The solution was not a simpler plane. It was a checklist.**

On 30 October 1935, the Boeing Model 299 — prototype for what would become the B-17 Flying Fortress — crashed at Wright Airfield in Ohio, killing two of its five crew members including the pilot. The cause: the pilot, managing the aircraft's unprecedented number of switches and controls, forgot to release a new locking mechanism on the elevator controls. Critics declared the aircraft "too complex to fly."

Boeing's engineers disagreed. The aircraft was not too complex to fly — it was too complex to be left to a pilot's memory. They created the first pilot's checklist: a structured sequence of critical action checks for taxi, takeoff, and landing. With the checklist in hand, pilots flew the subsequent 12 Model 299 aircraft 1.8 million miles without a single accident. The Army ultimately ordered nearly 13,000 B-17s, which gave the Allies a decisive air advantage in the Second World War.

The checklist became mandatory across all military aviation, then all commercial aviation. It remains the foundational safety tool in the industry.

**The deeper pattern — structured decision models:**

Aviation has not stopped at checklists. The industry has developed multiple constrained decision frameworks:

- **FOR-DEC** (Facts, Options, Risks & Benefits, Decision, Execution, Check) — developed by Lufthansa and the German Aerospace Centre in the 1990s as a prescriptive model for aeronautical decision-making. The hyphen between R and D is intentional: it forces the pilot to pause and reflect on whether anything essential has been missed before committing to a decision. FOR-DEC structures what would otherwise be an intuitive reaction into a deliberate sequential process.

- **Crew Resource Management (CRM)** — introduced after research showed that the majority of aviation accidents resulted not from technical failures but from failures in interpersonal communication, leadership, and decision-making. CRM is a structured approach to team decision-making that includes defined roles, standardised callouts, stabilised approach criteria, and explicit challenge-and-response protocols. It treats the cockpit as a constrained decision environment where every communication follows a defined pattern.

- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** — every phase of flight operates within a prescribed procedural framework. Deviation from SOPs requires explicit declaration and justification. The default is structure; the exception is deviation.

The aviation industry's safety record speaks for itself: commercial aviation accidents have declined steadily since the 1980s, precisely the period when CRM, structured checklists, and SOPs became systematically embedded in operations. The industry moved from a culture of individual heroism to a culture of structured constraint — and the result was dramatically fewer deaths.

**Circuit design implication:** The circuit borrows directly from aviation's design vocabulary. The 5-move sequence is a FOR-DEC analogue — a structured sequential model that forces deliberate processing where intuition would otherwise dominate. The progressive commitment structure mirrors CRM's challenge-and-response protocol. The artefact functions like a flight data recorder — a permanent, reviewable record of decisions made and the logic behind them. Most critically, the circuit adopts aviation's core insight: **the constraint is not for beginners. It is for professionals operating in conditions where the cost of error exceeds the cost of structure.**

### Precedent 3: Military Operations — Autonomy Within Constraint

**The paradox of military decision-making: maximum autonomy is achieved through maximum structure.**

The military has spent decades resolving a tension that maps directly onto the circuit's design challenge: how do you enable fast, decisive action by individual practitioners while ensuring consistency, quality, and accountability? The answer — developed independently across multiple military traditions — is **structured autonomy**: give the decision-maker a constrained framework, a clear objective, and freedom to act within those boundaries.

**Three military frameworks demonstrate this principle:**

**OODA Loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act)** — developed by US Air Force Colonel John Boyd in the early 1970s from his study of aerial combat, historic battles, and three wars. Boyd's central insight was that success in competitive environments depends not on superior resources but on the ability to move through a structured decision cycle faster than your opponent. The OODA loop imposes a four-stage constraint on what would otherwise be reactive, unstructured behaviour. Critically, Boyd identified Orientation as the most important stage — the phase where the decision-maker's mental models, cultural background, and experience shape how they interpret what they observe. This is not a passive phase; it is a structured intervention that forces the combatant to process information before acting.

**Auftragstaktik (Mission Command)** — the German military doctrine, adopted by NATO and the US military, that resolves the autonomy-constraint tension through a specific design: the commander defines the objective and constraints (the "what" and the boundaries), but the subordinate decides the method (the "how"). Superior commanders must give "no more orders than are essential" — every additional order is explicitly regarded as an additional constraint on the recipient. The system works because the constraint is minimal but non-negotiable: the objective must be achieved, the boundaries must be respected, but everything else is the decision-maker's call.

**After Action Review (AAR)** — originated by military historian S.L.A. Marshall during World War II and formalised in the 1970s, the AAR is a structured post-decision protocol that asks four questions: What was supposed to happen? What actually happened? Why was there a difference? What can we learn? Research demonstrates that highly structured AARs are significantly more effective than less-structured versions, and that team reflections cause significant increases in both team performance and the quality of team mental models over time. The AAR has been adopted by US fire fighters, public health emergency responders, and hospital settings.

**Circuit design implication:** The circuit synthesises all three military frameworks. Its 5-move structure is an OODA loop applied to professional decisions — Orientation maps to the circuit's Orientation move, Orient maps to Eligibility (processing criteria through the decision-maker's mental model), Decide maps to Declaration, Act maps to the Artefact. The circuit's constraint philosophy mirrors Auftragstaktik: it defines the what (reach a decision) and the boundaries (5 moves, sufficiency declaration, artefact production) but leaves the content of each move entirely to the decision-maker. The Calibration Capture is a personal AAR — a structured post-decision reflection protocol that asks not "how did it feel?" but "what changed?" The military has proven for decades that this combination — structured framework plus individual autonomy within it — produces superior outcomes under pressure.

### Precedent 4: Law — Structure as Justice

**The legal profession's discovery: unconstrained judicial discretion produces inconsistency that undermines justice itself.**

The legal system provides perhaps the most instructive precedent for the circuit, because it faces the identical challenge: how do you structure a consequential decision process without removing the professional judgment that makes it meaningful?

**Sentencing guidelines** represent the legal system's most explicit experiment with constrained decision environments. The US Federal Sentencing Guidelines, introduced in 1987, were created from a specific diagnosis: unconstrained judicial discretion produced unacceptable inconsistency. Similar offenders committing similar offences received dramatically different sentences depending on which judge heard the case. The solution was structural — a framework that constrained the decision space while preserving judicial discretion within defined boundaries.

The evidence on sentencing guidelines reveals a nuanced finding directly relevant to the circuit: **structure alone cannot eliminate all variation in judicial decision-making, but it dramatically reduces the range of variation.** Even within the highly structured federal sentencing framework, some variation persists. This is not a failure of the system — it is evidence that structure constrains without mechanising. The judge still judges. The structure ensures they judge within a defensible, transparent framework.

**Structured judicial reasoning** — beyond sentencing guidelines, legal systems worldwide require judges to produce written judgments that document their reasoning process. This is not optional documentation; it is a constitutional requirement in many jurisdictions. The judgment must show: what evidence was considered, what legal principles were applied, how competing arguments were weighed, and why the conclusion follows from the reasoning. The judgment is a professional artefact — a permanent record of structured decision-making that can be reviewed, challenged, and learned from.

**The continuum of constraint:** Legal scholarship identifies that guidance occurs along a continuum — from almost entirely quantitative measurement at one extreme (mandatory sentencing grids) to broad principled guidance at the other (general sentencing principles with judicial discretion). The most effective systems sit in the middle: structured enough to ensure consistency and transparency, flexible enough to accommodate the complexity of individual cases.

**Circuit design implication:** The circuit sits precisely where the most effective legal frameworks sit: structured enough to ensure consistency and produce a reviewable artefact, flexible enough to accommodate the complexity of each individual decision. The 5-move sequence is the equivalent of structured judicial reasoning — it requires the decision-maker to show their working at each stage. The artefact is the equivalent of a written judgment — a permanent record of the decision, the reasoning, and the constraints that shaped it. The token model is the equivalent of filing fees — a commitment mechanism that signals seriousness. And like the best sentencing guidelines, the circuit constrains without mechanising: the decision-maker still decides. The structure ensures they decide within a defensible, transparent, and reviewable framework.

### Synthesis: The Cross-Domain Pattern

The four precedents reveal a pattern so consistent it constitutes a design principle:

| Domain | Constraint Mechanism | Declaration Requirement | Artefact Produced | Outcome Evidence |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Medicine | Checklists, protocols, SPJ | Verbal confirmation at each stage | Clinical records, assessment reports | 47% mortality reduction (WHO checklist) |
| Aviation | FOR-DEC, CRM, SOPs | Challenge-and-response callouts | Flight data records, incident reports | Steady accident decline since 1980s |
| Military | OODA, Auftragstaktik, AAR | Mission confirmation, after-action questions | Operations orders, AAR documents | Improved team performance and learning |
| Law | Sentencing guidelines, structured reasoning | Findings of fact, legal conclusions | Written judgments | Reduced sentencing disparity |

**The common elements across all four domains:**

1. **Sequential structure**: Decisions proceed through defined stages, not in a single intuitive leap
2. **Forced declaration**: Each stage requires explicit confirmation before the next can begin
3. **Constraint as enablement**: Structure does not replace professional judgment — it makes professional judgment reliable
4. **Artefact production**: Every decision produces a reviewable, permanent record of the process and reasoning
5. **Post-decision review**: Structured reflection protocols improve future decision quality

**The circuit implements all five elements.** The 5-move sequence provides sequential structure. Each move requires forced declaration. The constraint design enables rather than replaces professional judgment. The artefact documents the decision process. The Calibration Capture provides post-decision review.

**What makes the circuit novel is not its design principles — those are proven across four high-stakes professions. What makes it novel is applying those principles to everyday professional decisions**, where the cost of poor decisions is real but the infrastructure of constraint does not yet exist. Medicine has operating theatres. Aviation has cockpits. The military has command centres. Law has courtrooms. The gap buyer has nothing — until the circuit.

## Calibration Science, Sufficiency Theory, and Artefact Design

### The Three Mechanisms That Make the Circuit Work

The circuit's design rests on three distinctive features that distinguish it from every other professional decision tool: the **Calibration Capture** (a post-decision self-assessment protocol), the **Sufficiency Boundary** (a forced "enough" declaration), and the **Artefact** (a permanent decision record). Each has deep roots in established science — but none has been combined into a single product before.

This section examines the scientific foundations for each mechanism, the evidence supporting its effectiveness, and the specific design principles that emerge for the circuit.

---

### 1. Calibration Science: The Problem of Self-Assessment

**The core problem: humans are systematically poor at assessing their own competence — and the least competent are the most overconfident.**

#### The Dunning-Kruger Effect and Metacognitive Blindness

In 1999, David Dunning and Justin Kruger published research demonstrating a pervasive pattern: individuals who perform in the bottom quartile of a skill consistently overestimate their competence. In their studies, those performing at the 12th percentile rated their expertise, on average, at the 62nd percentile — a 50-percentile-point overestimation. Conversely, high performers slightly underestimated their abilities.

The metacognitive explanation is critical for the circuit: the skills needed to produce correct responses are the same skills needed to recognise what a correct response looks like. Low performers lack the very discriminatory ability needed to assess their own performance. This creates a double burden — they make errors AND they cannot see the errors they make.

In medical training, the pattern is consistent: junior physicians assessed in the lowest quartile by their colleagues rated themselves 30 to 40 percentile ranks higher than their peers did. Paradoxically, by the time low-performing individuals achieve accuracy in their self-assessments, their performance has already improved — calibration follows competence, not the reverse.

**The critical implication:** unstructured self-reflection ("How do you think that went?") is unreliable precisely when it matters most. It is most inaccurate for the people who most need it. Self-assessment must be structured, prompted, and anchored to specific dimensions to produce useful signal.

#### Tetlock's Superforecasters: What Good Calibration Looks Like

Philip Tetlock's Good Judgment Project — a four-year experiment with more than 5,000 forecasters — identified 260 "superforecasters" who consistently outperformed intelligence analysts with access to classified information. Their distinguishing characteristic was not domain expertise. It was **calibration accuracy**: when superforecasters said something had a 70% probability, it happened approximately 70% of the time.

Tetlock's key findings on what produces calibration:

- **Keeping score** — tracking predictions against outcomes produces calibration over time
- **Thinking probabilistically** — using percentages rather than binary yes/no assessments
- **Willingness to update** — adjusting estimates as new information emerges
- **Structured feedback** — calibration improves only when forecasters receive feedback on their accuracy

Without feedback, people assume they are doing well and become overconfident. With structured feedback, calibration improves systematically. The mechanism is not reflection — it is structured comparison between prediction and outcome.

#### Metacognitive Scaffolding: What Actually Improves Self-Assessment

Research in educational psychology demonstrates that **metacognitive scaffolds** — structured prompts that guide self-assessment — significantly improve calibration accuracy. Specifically:

- Presenting decision-makers with their diagnostic paths and highlighting correct versus incorrect choices helps them become more metacognitively accurate in their confidence judgments
- **Performance-based cues** (concrete, specific prompts about what happened) produce better self-assessment accuracy than abstract reflection
- **Forced-choice assessment formats** — where respondents must rank competing statements rather than rate themselves on a single scale — encourage deeper reflection and make it harder to inflate self-assessment
- Self-assessment is not an innate skill — it must be taught, modelled, and reinforced through structured practice
- Combining self-assessment with explicit criteria, goal-setting, and feedback from structured dimensions enhances accuracy

The consistent finding: **calibration improves through structured prompts anchored to specific dimensions, not through open-ended reflection.**

#### Circuit Design Implication: The Calibration Capture

The Calibration Capture is designed around these findings:

1. **It is post-decision, not reflective** — it asks "what changed?" not "how did you feel?" This captures concrete behavioural data, not subjective impression
2. **It uses forced-choice prompts** — three structured questions with defined options, not open text fields. This prevents the Dunning-Kruger inflation that occurs with unstructured self-assessment
3. **It anchors to specific dimensions** — Behavioural Interruption ("Did the circuit change what you would have done?"), Sufficiency Boundary ("Did the 'enough' declaration alter your information-gathering pattern?"), Cost Acceptance ("Do you accept the cost of this decision?"). Each dimension is concrete and observable
4. **It is classification, not reflection** — the user categorises their experience against defined options, not narratives. This mirrors Tetlock's finding that calibration requires structured comparison, not open-ended introspection
5. **Over time, it creates a personal calibration dataset** — repeated Calibration Captures across multiple circuit uses build a self-assessment record that enables pattern recognition. This mirrors the superforecaster finding that keeping score produces calibration

### 2. Sufficiency Theory: The Science of "Enough"

**The core problem: in a world of unlimited information, knowing when to stop is harder — and more important — than knowing where to start.**

#### The Optimal Stopping Problem

The "secretary problem" (also known as the best-choice problem) is mathematics' most elegant formalisation of the "when to stop" question. Given *n* candidates interviewed one at a time, with an immediate accept/reject decision required for each, the mathematically optimal strategy is to reject the first *n/e* candidates (approximately 37%), then accept the next candidate who is better than all those previously seen.

The 37% rule carries a profound implication: **the optimal stopping point is not at the end of the search. It is roughly one-third of the way through.** Searching exhaustively — examining every option — is mathematically suboptimal. The best strategy involves a deliberate boundary that says "stop here."

This finding has been validated across domains: apartment rentals, house sales, parking spaces, partner selection, stock market timing, and software release decisions. In every case, the optimal strategy involves a stopping rule, not exhaustive search.

#### The Explore-Exploit Tradeoff

Decision science formalises the tension between gathering more information (exploration) and acting on what you know (exploitation). Too much exploration wastes resources and produces "analysis paralysis." Too much exploitation — acting prematurely — risks missing critical information.

The research is clear on when to exploit:

- **When time is limited** — exploitation becomes adaptive under time pressure
- **When cognitive resources are low** — continued exploration under fatigue produces diminishing returns
- **When the environment is volatile** — in rapidly changing conditions, information gathered early becomes stale, making extended exploration counterproductive
- **When the cost of delay exceeds the value of additional information** — the gap buyer's signature condition

The explore-exploit framework provides the theoretical basis for a forced stopping point: there is an optimal moment to stop gathering information and act, and that moment comes before you have all the information you would like to have.

#### Satisficing Thresholds and Stopping Rules

Simon's satisficing model establishes that effective decision-makers set an **aspiration level** — a threshold of acceptability — and select the first option that meets or exceeds it. Research on stopping rules identifies multiple mechanisms:

- **The satiation rule** — search terminates when the decision-maker has found a sufficient number of satisfactory options
- **The disgust rule** — search terminates when the cost of continuing (examining irrelevant options) exceeds the expected benefit
- **Aspiration-level adaptation** — if no option meets the threshold after a defined period, the threshold adjusts and search continues

Critically, research confirms that **satisficers report greater satisfaction with their decisions than maximisers** despite (or because of) searching less. The satisficing threshold is not a compromise on quality — it is the strategy that produces the highest combination of decision quality and decision satisfaction.

The intersection of information foraging and satisficing reveals that stopping rules are shaped by both user characteristics (experience, knowledge) and environmental factors (information presentation, interface design). This means the environment can be designed to support appropriate stopping.

#### Circuit Design Implication: The Sufficiency Boundary

The Sufficiency Boundary is the circuit's implementation of optimal stopping theory:

1. **It forces a stopping declaration** — the user must explicitly state "I have enough information to decide." This operationalises the satisficing threshold as a product feature
2. **It makes the cost of delay visible** — by requiring the declaration within the circuit's constraint (the 5-move structure, the token already spent), it frames continued analysis as a cost rather than a benefit
3. **It is a designed stopping rule** — the circuit's environment is structured to support appropriate stopping, not endless exploration. The 5-move limit is the environmental design that makes the stopping rule natural rather than forced
4. **It separates the sufficiency judgment from the decision itself** — the user declares "I have enough" (Move 4) before producing the artefact (Move 5). This mirrors the optimal stopping literature's finding that the best stopping rules involve a distinct "stop" decision before the "act" decision
5. **It accepts that optimal stopping is earlier than intuition suggests** — the 37% rule demonstrates that people systematically search too long. The circuit's constraint corrects for this by imposing a structural boundary on information gathering

### 3. Artefact Design: The Power of Making Decisions Visible

**The core finding: documenting a decision does not merely record it. It improves it.**

#### Cognitive Offloading and the Extended Mind

Cognitive science has established that writing is not merely a recording function — it is a thinking function. **Cognitive offloading** — the use of physical action to alter the information processing requirements of a task — has been practised for millennia through writing, and research confirms its systematic effects on cognitive performance.

When information is externalised (written down, diagrammed, or otherwise made visible), working memory is freed for higher-order processing. The act of cognitive offloading releases resources which would otherwise be necessary to hold information in short-term representations. This is not a convenience — it is a cognitive architecture feature. The human mind performs better when it can distribute processing between internal representations and external artefacts.

The **extended mind hypothesis** (Clark and Chalmers) posits that cognitive systems are not bounded by the skull — they include the tools, notebooks, and environmental structures that people use to think. Under this view, a decision artefact is not separate from the decision process. It is part of the decision process. Writing the decision IS making the decision, not recording it after the fact.

#### Documentation Effects on Decision Quality

Research on decision documentation demonstrates measurable improvements in decision quality:

- **Writing exposes reasoning gaps** — while speaking can gloss over details, writing forces precision and reveals weaknesses in arguments that verbal reasoning conceals
- **Documentation improves both individual and team decision-making** — research shows that when decision-makers use structured documentation techniques, effectiveness significantly improves while efficiency remains unaltered
- **Structured formats force consideration of alternatives and tradeoffs** — the discipline of documenting options, reasoning, and consequences explicitly produces more deliberate decision-making
- **Decision records create accountability** — documented decisions tie specific reasoning to specific individuals, fostering ownership and preventing revisionism

The benefits extend beyond the moment of decision. Decision documentation creates a **learning loop**: reviewing past decisions against their outcomes enables calibration (connecting back to Section 1). This is precisely what Tetlock found distinguishes superforecasters — they keep score by documenting predictions and comparing them to results.

#### Architecture Decision Records: A Working Model

In software engineering, **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** provide a mature precedent for professional decision artefacts. An ADR captures a single architectural decision along with its context, rationale, alternatives considered, and consequences. Key benefits validated through widespread adoption:

- **Transparency** — ADRs make the reasoning behind decisions visible to all stakeholders
- **Knowledge retention** — ADRs outlive individual team members, preserving nuanced context that traditional documentation misses
- **Improved onboarding** — new team members can understand the reasoning behind existing decisions without having to reconstruct it from code
- **Accountability** — each decision is tied to specific individuals and rationale
- **Forced deliberation** — the structured format compels decision-makers to articulate alternatives and tradeoffs explicitly

The UK Government's Digital Service has published an **Architectural Decision Record Framework** as official guidance, validating the pattern as institutional practice, not just developer preference.

The ADR model demonstrates that structured decision artefacts are not bureaucratic overhead — they are professional instruments that improve decision quality, team alignment, and institutional learning.

#### Circuit Design Implication: The Artefact

The circuit's artefact is the product's most strategically significant feature, grounded in three bodies of evidence:

1. **It is a cognitive offloading mechanism** — by externalising the decision into a structured document, the artefact frees working memory during the decision process itself. The user thinks through the decision by writing it, not after writing it
2. **It forces reasoning precision** — like ADRs, the artefact's structured format requires the decision-maker to articulate what they decided, why, what alternatives existed, and what sufficiency criteria were met. This exposure of reasoning gaps during writing improves the decision being documented
3. **It creates a permanent, shareable record** — the artefact is the circuit's equivalent of a flight data record, a written judicial judgment, or an ADR. It can be reviewed, shared with stakeholders, and used for future calibration
4. **It enables the "artefact as marketing" strategy** — every completed circuit produces a professional decision record. These records are shareable, credible, and demonstrate the circuit's value to potential users. The product markets itself through its output
5. **It closes the learning loop** — artefacts accumulated over time create a personal decision archive. Combined with Calibration Capture data, this archive enables the kind of structured review that Tetlock identifies as the foundation of calibration improvement. The artefact is not the end of the process — it is the beginning of the next calibration cycle

### Synthesis: The Three Mechanisms as an Integrated System

The Calibration Capture, Sufficiency Boundary, and Artefact are not three independent features. They are an integrated system where each mechanism reinforces the others:

| Mechanism | Scientific Foundation | What It Addresses | How It Connects |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Calibration Capture | Dunning-Kruger, Tetlock, metacognitive scaffolding | Self-assessment accuracy | Feeds data back to improve future sufficiency judgments and artefact quality |
| Sufficiency Boundary | Optimal stopping, satisficing, explore-exploit | Analysis paralysis, over-research | Forces the transition from exploration to exploitation — the moment the artefact becomes possible |
| Artefact | Cognitive offloading, documentation effects, ADR model | Decision visibility, accountability, learning | Creates the permanent record that enables future calibration and public credibility |

**The feedback loop:**

1. The **Sufficiency Boundary** declares "I have enough" → enabling the artefact
2. The **Artefact** externalises the decision → creating a reviewable record
3. The **Calibration Capture** classifies the decision experience → generating self-assessment data
4. Over time, accumulated Calibration Captures improve the decision-maker's ability to set accurate sufficiency boundaries → improving future artefact quality

This is not a linear process. It is a calibration engine — a system designed to improve its own inputs over time. The more circuits a user completes, the better their calibration becomes, the more accurate their sufficiency judgments, and the higher the quality of their artefacts.

**No existing product implements this loop.** Enterprise platforms produce reports (artefacts without calibration). Coaching produces reflection (calibration without artefacts). Analytics produces data (information without sufficiency boundaries). The circuit is the first product to integrate all three mechanisms into a self-reinforcing system.

## Strategic Synthesis and Recommendations

### Executive Summary

This domain research has examined the scientific, professional, and design foundations for the 5-Move Judgement Circuit — a constrained professional decision environment designed to improve decision quality through structure, forced commitment, and artefact production.

**The evidence is unambiguous across three independent lines of inquiry:**

1. **Decision science** (8 theories, 7 decades of research, 3 Nobel Prize winners) confirms that constraint, structure, and forced commitment improve decision quality. This is not contested in the literature. The only question is why no product has yet applied these principles to everyday professional decisions.

2. **Professional precedent** (4 high-stakes domains — medicine, aviation, military, law) demonstrates that constrained decision environments already work at scale in the most consequential professional settings on earth. The pattern is consistent: sequential structure, forced declaration, artefact production, and post-decision review. The circuit implements all five common elements identified across these domains.

3. **Mechanism science** (calibration, sufficiency, and artefact design research) validates the circuit's three distinctive features individually and as an integrated system. The Calibration Capture is grounded in metacognitive scaffolding and superforecaster methodology. The Sufficiency Boundary implements optimal stopping theory. The Artefact leverages cognitive offloading and the Architecture Decision Record model. Together, they form a self-reinforcing calibration engine.

**The strategic conclusion:** The circuit's design is not speculative. It is the application of established science to an underserved market segment. The gap is not in the evidence — the gap is in the product landscape.

### Design Validation Matrix

The following matrix maps every core circuit feature to its scientific and professional validation:

| Circuit Feature | Decision Science Validation | Professional Precedent | Mechanism Science |
|----------------|---------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **5-move constraint** | Less-Is-More (Gigerenzer), Paradox of Choice (Schwartz), Cognitive Load (Sweller) | FOR-DEC (aviation), OODA loop (military), clinical protocols (medicine) | Optimal stopping theory (37% rule) |
| **Sequential structure** | Decision Hygiene/Mediating Assessments (Kahneman et al.), Dual Process activation | WHO surgical checklist (3 junctures), CRM challenge-and-response, structured judicial reasoning | Cognitive offloading (sequential working memory management) |
| **Forced declaration at each move** | System 2 activation triggers (Kahneman), Commitment devices (Ariely) | Verbal confirmation (surgery), SOPs (aviation), mission confirmation (military), findings of fact (law) | Forced-choice assessment formats improve self-assessment accuracy |
| **Sufficiency boundary** | Bounded Rationality/Satisficing (Simon), Choice Architecture defaults (Thaler & Sunstein) | Diagnostic stopping rules (medicine), aspiration levels (military mission command) | Explore-exploit tradeoff, satisficing thresholds, stopping rules |
| **Token model (pay per decision)** | Commitment devices, irreversibility effect | Filing fees (law), licensing requirements (all professions) | Commitment increases follow-through, irreversibility improves satisfaction |
| **Artefact output** | Choice Architecture feedback mechanism (Thaler & Sunstein) | Flight data records (aviation), written judgments (law), AARs (military), clinical records (medicine) | Cognitive offloading, ADR model, documentation improves decision quality |
| **Calibration Capture** | Decision Noise/hygiene audit (Kahneman et al.) | After Action Review (military), medical debriefs | Dunning-Kruger mitigation, Tetlock's superforecaster methodology, metacognitive scaffolding |
| **Cold start (no pre-circuit content)** | System 2 activation requires interruption of System 1 defaults, Cognitive Load minimisation | Aviation checklists begin at a defined point (not after briefing), OODA begins with Observe (not with theory) | Immediate action IS the intervention — externalising from the first moment |
| **Eligibility gate (free failures)** | Choice Architecture (expecting error), Less-Is-More (not every decision warrants the circuit) | Triage systems (medicine), threat assessment (military), case acceptance criteria (law) | Self-selection reduces noise by filtering inappropriate use cases |
| **Gaming is self-punishing** | Commitment device theory — cost of gaming exceeds cost of genuine use | Professional licensing — gaming a medical exam harms the cheater, not the system | Forced-choice formats resist inflation; token cost makes gaming economically irrational |

**Every core feature maps to at least three independent sources of validation.** No feature relies on a single theory, a single precedent, or a single mechanism. This convergent validation is the circuit's strongest strategic asset.

### Strategic Recommendations

#### Recommendation 1: Lead with the Science in Positioning

The circuit's scientific foundation is not supplementary marketing material. It is the product's primary credibility mechanism. In a market where decision tools rely on proprietary frameworks, consultant authority, or brand trust, the circuit can point to:

- 3 Nobel Prize winners whose research directly validates the design (Simon, Kahneman, Thaler)
- A 47% mortality reduction from a 19-item checklist (Gawande/WHO) as proof that constraint works
- 4 professional domains that already use constrained decision environments at scale
- Convergent evidence from 8 independent theoretical frameworks

**Actionable implication:** The product's landing page, sales materials, and credibility claims should cite specific studies, not generic "evidence-based" language. The research in this document provides ready-to-use citations for every design choice.

#### Recommendation 2: Position the Circuit as "Infrastructure for a Category That Doesn't Exist Yet"

The market research (completed separately) identified a structural gap between $50 consumer apps and $500+ professional instruments. The domain research confirms why this gap exists: no product has applied the design principles that high-stakes professions take for granted to everyday professional decisions.

The circuit is not competing with existing decision tools. It is creating infrastructure for a decision category that currently has no product at all — the £20-£50 consequential decision.

**Actionable implication:** Avoid comparative positioning against existing tools. Instead, position against the status quo of no structured decision process — the "I'll think about it" that costs professionals weeks of delay and thousands in opportunity cost.

#### Recommendation 3: Protect the Cold Start and Constraint Design as Non-Negotiable

The domain research reveals a consistent finding across all four professional precedents: **the constraint IS the value.** The moment you add optional pre-circuit content, guidance, or coaching, you are designing against the science.

- Aviation checklists work because they are mandatory, not optional
- The WHO checklist works because it forces confirmation, not because it provides information
- Auftragstaktik works because the constraint is minimal but non-negotiable
- Sentencing guidelines work because they constrain, not because they advise

The cold start (no pre-circuit content) and the 5-move constraint are the circuit's most scientifically validated features. Weakening them for user comfort would be designing against the evidence.

**Actionable implication:** Treat the cold start and the 5-move constraint as architectural invariants, not configurable features. If users request pre-circuit guidance, the correct response is that the absence of guidance is the design. The science supports this position unambiguously.

#### Recommendation 4: Build the Calibration Engine as the Long-Term Moat

The Calibration Capture → Sufficiency Boundary → Artefact feedback loop is the circuit's most defensible competitive advantage because:

- It improves with use (network effects are personal, not social)
- It produces proprietary data that no competitor can replicate
- It creates switching costs (a user's calibration history is valuable and non-transferable)
- It is grounded in superforecaster methodology (the gold standard for calibration improvement)

**Actionable implication:** Invest early in the data infrastructure for storing and surfacing Calibration Capture data across multiple circuit completions. The calibration engine is what transforms the circuit from a decision tool into a decision practice.

#### Recommendation 5: Use the Professional Precedent Narrative for Credibility, Not the Science

While the scientific foundations are rigorous, the professional precedents are more persuasive for the target buyer. "Surgeons use checklists. Pilots use FOR-DEC. Military commanders use OODA. Judges use structured reasoning. You use... nothing." is a more compelling sales narrative than "Bounded rationality theory suggests..."

**Actionable implication:** Lead with precedent stories (the Boeing Model 299, the WHO surgical checklist, the OODA loop) in marketing. Reserve the detailed science for the product's credibility documentation, blog content, and authority-building materials.

### Risk Assessment from Domain Research

| Risk | Evidence Assessment | Mitigation |
|------|-------------------|------------|
| Constraint resistance ("I don't want to be limited") | Expected — Gawande documented physician resistance to surgical checklists. Overcome through outcome evidence | Position constraint as professional practice, not limitation. "Pilots don't find checklists demeaning" |
| Calibration Capture perceived as assessment | Dunning-Kruger research shows people resist being assessed when they overestimate competence | Frame as classification, not evaluation. "We never ask how it went. We ask what changed" |
| Category creation failure | Blue ocean strategy research suggests ~30% of new categories fail to establish | The four professional precedents prove the category already exists in other domains — this is category transfer, not creation |
| Oversimplification criticism | Gigerenzer's research directly addresses this: fast-and-frugal outperforms complex in the right environments | Cite the heart attack checklist: 3 yes/no questions outperform 19-point analysis |
| Decision fatigue market timing | Gartner predicts 60% of large enterprises will use AI decision tools by 2026 — demand is growing | The circuit is not an AI tool — it is a human constraint environment. Complementary, not competitive, with AI decision support |

### Confidence Assessment

| Research Area | Confidence Level | Basis |
|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| Decision science foundations | **Very High** | Peer-reviewed, Nobel Prize-validated, replicated across decades |
| Professional precedent mapping | **Very High** | Documented institutional practice with measured outcomes |
| Calibration Capture design validation | **High** | Strong theoretical basis; specific product implementation untested |
| Sufficiency Boundary design validation | **High** | Optimal stopping theory well-established; specific implementation untested |
| Artefact design validation | **High** | ADR model proven in software engineering; transfer to general professional decisions untested |
| Integrated feedback loop (3 mechanisms) | **Moderate-High** | Each mechanism individually validated; the specific combination is novel and unproven |
| Market timing and demand | **Moderate** | Decision fatigue awareness growing; willingness-to-pay for constraint-based tools unvalidated |

## Research Methodology

### Research Approach

This domain research was conducted using a structured multi-phase methodology:

1. **Scope confirmation** — Research boundaries, goals, and approach confirmed with the research partner
2. **Decision Science Foundations** — Systematic web-verified review of 8 major theoretical frameworks from behavioural economics, cognitive psychology, and decision science
3. **Constrained Environment Precedents** — Cross-domain analysis of 4 high-stakes professional environments (medicine, aviation, military, law)
4. **Mechanism Science** — Deep-dive investigation of the three circuit-specific features (Calibration Capture, Sufficiency Boundary, Artefact)
5. **Strategic Synthesis** — Integration of all findings into design validation, strategic recommendations, and risk assessment

### Source Standards

- **All factual claims verified against current public sources** with URLs provided
- **Multi-source validation** for critical claims — no major finding relies on a single source
- **Academic preference** — peer-reviewed publications, established textbooks, and institutional sources prioritised over commercial or opinion sources
- **Confidence levels** applied to all findings based on evidence strength and replication

### Research Limitations

- The circuit's specific combination of features (5-move constraint + Calibration Capture + Sufficiency Boundary + Artefact) is novel — while each component is individually validated, the integrated system has not been empirically tested
- Professional precedent mapping is analogical — the circuit applies principles from medicine, aviation, military, and law to a different context (everyday professional decisions). The transfer assumption is strongly supported but not empirically confirmed
- Willingness-to-pay for constraint-based decision environments in the £20-£50 range is theoretically supported but not validated through market testing
- The Dunning-Kruger effect has faced methodological criticism — while the empirical findings are broadly accepted, the metacognitive explanation is contested

### Search Queries Executed
