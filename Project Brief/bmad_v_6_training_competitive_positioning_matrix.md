# BMAD v6 Training Programme
## Competitive Positioning Matrix

This document compares the proposed **BMAD v6 Training Programme** against existing training, certification, and education offerings that cover adjacent ground (product management, execution frameworks, systems thinking, AI strategy, and professional certification).

The purpose of this matrix is:
- To clarify **true differentiation** (not marketing claims)
- To inform **pricing, tiering, and certification design**
- To reduce the risk of building a product that already exists under another name

---

## Compared Offerings

- **BMAD v6 Training Programme** (proposed)
- Pragmatic Institute (Product Management training & certification)
- Reforge (framework-centric cohort learning)
- AIPMM (Certified Product Manager & related credentials)
- Coursera / Udemy (mass-market online learning platforms)

## 1. Core Positioning & Intent

| Dimension | BMAD v6 Training | Pragmatic Institute | Reforge | AIPMM | Coursera / Udemy |
|---------|-----------------|--------------------|--------|-------|------------------|
| Primary intent | Execution system mastery | Product management best practices | Systems thinking for growth & product | Credentialing | Skill acquisition |
| Method as core | **Yes (BMAD)** | Yes (Pragmatic Framework) | Partial | Partial | No |
| AI-first worldview | **Native** | Add-on | Emerging | Minimal | Inconsistent |
| Decision frameworks | **Central** | Moderate | Strong | Weak | Rare |

**Key insight**: Only BMAD and Pragmatic are truly *method-first*. BMAD is the only one designed for AI-mediated execution as a first-class concern.

---

## 2. Structure, Modularity & Updateability

| Dimension | BMAD v6 Training | Pragmatic | Reforge | AIPMM | Coursera / Udemy |
|---------|-----------------|----------|--------|-------|------------------|
| Modular by design | **Yes (BMAD modules)** | Semi | Yes | No | No |
| Updatable without re-record | **Yes (explicit goal)** | Limited | Limited | No | No |
| Version awareness | **Yes** | Weak | Weak | No | No |
| Longevity planning | **Built-in** | Medium | Medium | Low | Very low |

**Key insight**: Most competitors are content-locked to time. BMAD’s modular, version-aware approach is a structural advantage.

---

## 3. Certification & Signalling Value

| Dimension | BMAD v6 Training | Pragmatic | Reforge | AIPMM | Coursera / Udemy |
|---------|-----------------|----------|--------|-------|------------------|
| Certification offered | **Yes (planned)** | Yes | No / light credential | Yes | Sometimes |
| Verification rigor | **High (designed)** | Medium | Low | Medium | Very low |
| Signals competence vs attendance | **Competence** | Mixed | Attendance | Attendance | Attendance |
| Enforcement credibility | **Designed-in** | Organisation-based | Social | Organisation-based | None |

**Key insight**: There is room for a genuinely credible execution-level certification if standards remain strict.

---

## 4. UX, Pedagogy & Learning Experience

| Dimension | BMAD v6 Training | Pragmatic | Reforge | AIPMM | Coursera / Udemy |
|---------|-----------------|----------|--------|-------|------------------|
| Cognitive load management | **Planned** | Medium | Strong | Weak | Weak |
| Scenario-based learning | **Yes** | Some | Yes | Rare | Rare |
| Tool-integrated learning | **Yes** | No | Limited | No | No |
| Accessibility focus | **WCAG 2.2 target** | Partial | Partial | Unknown | Inconsistent |

**Key insight**: Reforge sets the benchmark for learning UX. BMAD should aim to match or exceed it, especially around scenarios and decision-making.

---

## 5. Commercial Model & Pricing Power

| Dimension | BMAD v6 Training | Pragmatic | Reforge | AIPMM | Coursera / Udemy |
|---------|-----------------|----------|--------|-------|------------------|
| Typical pricing | **£100–£1,000+ (tiered)** | £1k–£3k | £1k+/year | £500–£1k | £10–£100 |
| Meaningful tiering | **Yes** | Yes | Yes | Weak | Cosmetic |
| Agency-friendly | **Yes** | Yes | Yes | Some | No |
| Perceived ROI | **High** | High | High | Medium | Low |

**Key insight**: The proposed pricing band is credible, particularly for agencies and teams.

---

## 6. Security, IP & Professionalism

| Dimension | BMAD v6 Training | Pragmatic | Reforge | AIPMM | Coursera / Udemy |
|---------|-----------------|----------|--------|-------|------------------|
| Security posture | **Explicit, high** | Adequate | Adequate | Unknown | Variable |
| Anti-piracy stance | **Deterrence-based** | Minimal | Minimal | Minimal | None |
| IP seriousness | **Core concern** | High | Medium | Medium | Low |
| Enterprise trust | **Potentially high** | High | High | Medium | Low |

**Key insight**: Most training products do not operate at enterprise-grade expectations around security and IP.

---

## Strategic Summary

### Closest Comparables
- **Spirit**: Reforge (systems thinking)
- **Structure**: Pragmatic Institute (method-driven training)
- **Rigor**: Potentially higher than both if verification and standards are enforced

### Genuine Differentiators
1. AI-first execution methodology
2. Method + meta-method (deciding *how much* BMAD to apply)
3. Modular, updateable, version-aware training
4. Certification with verification, not attendance badges
5. Training artefacts that double as reusable BMAD modules

---

## Positioning Implications

- Do **not** position this as generic product management training
- Position it as:
  > A decision and execution system for AI-mediated work
- Make certification deliberately hard
- Optimise for long-term credibility over short-term scale

---

## Internal One-Line Positioning

> Most courses teach what to do.
> BMAD teaches how to decide what to do — with AI, at scale.
