# BMAD v6 Training – Day‑1 Features That Directly Solve the Core Problem

This document answers a **critical commercial viability question**:

> *“What does the learner actually see and interact with on Day 1 — beyond philosophy?”*

It translates the hardened 5‑move MVP into **concrete product features** that a learner can log into, use, and leave changed.

The goal is not to design a platform.
It is to ensure that **every Day‑1 feature directly addresses the core problem**:

> **Loss of judgement under scrutiny, replaced by overwork, proxy authority, and decision paralysis.**

---

## Core Product Rule

If a feature does not:
- force ownership,
- constrain scope,
- or create a defensible stop,

…it does not belong on Day 1.

Day 1 is not onboarding.
It is **intervention**.

---

## The Minimum Day‑1 Feature Set (What Actually Exists)

A learner logging in on Day 1 sees **exactly five things**, in this order.

No dashboards. No feeds. No libraries.

---

## 1. Eligibility Gate (Hard Stop Screen)

**What the learner sees**:
- A single page asking:
  > “Is this decision worth structuring?”

With:
- One short explanation of *why not all decisions qualify*
- Two buttons:
  - **Yes — this decision carries risk**
  - **No — this is not worth it**

If **No** is selected:
- The session ends
- The learner is explicitly told *not to continue*

**Why this matters**:
- Immediately breaks the habit of over-application
- Establishes that stopping is success

This screen alone differentiates BMAD from 90% of training products.

---

## 2. Decision Declaration Screen (Ownership Lock)

**What the learner sees**:
- A single text input with the prompt:
  > “The decision I am making is…”

Constraints:
- First‑person only (“I am deciding…”)
- Character‑limited
- No placeholders or examples visible by default

Disallowed language is flagged:
- “AI suggests…”
- “The framework says…”
- “We decided…” (without role)

**Why this matters**:
- Forces ownership
- Prevents proxy authority
- Creates psychological commitment

---

## 3. Sufficiency Framing Screen (The Core Skill)

**What the learner sees**:
Three required fields:

1. **What information is enough to decide?**
2. **What are you explicitly *not* finding out?**
3. **What risk are you accepting by stopping here?**

Each field is:
- Short
- Mandatory
- Non‑expandable

**Why this matters**:
- Converts vague confidence into explicit trade‑offs
- Trains stopping as a skill, not a feeling

This is the heart of the product.

---

## 4. Decision Artefact (Two‑Minute Defence Constraint)

**What the learner sees**:
- A generated, minimal decision record containing:
  - The decision
  - The sufficiency rationale
  - The rejected alternative

Plus one instruction:

> “You should be able to defend this in under two minutes.”

Optional:
- Record a short audio or written defence (time‑boxed)

**Why this matters**:
- Produces something usable immediately
- Makes judgement externally legible without bloating

---

## 5. Stop / Go Commitment Screen (Irreversibility)

**What the learner sees**:
Two buttons:
- **Stop and commit**
- **Do not proceed**

If **Stop and commit**:
- The learner must name:
  - One downside they accept
  - One condition that would change the decision

If **Do not proceed**:
- The artefact is archived
- The learner is told this is a valid outcome

**Why this matters**:
- Converts clarity into commitment
- Normalises stopping as success

---

## What the Learner Does *Not* See on Day 1

Deliberately absent:

- Progress indicators
- Completion status
- Video libraries
- Community areas
- Metrics or scores
- “Next lesson” prompts

Day 1 ends when the decision ends.

---

## Why This Solves the Core Problem

On Day 1, the learner:

- Stops over‑applying structure
- Owns a real decision
- Names sufficiency explicitly
- Produces a defensible artefact
- Commits and accepts risk

That is the full problem.

No theory is required to experience this shift.

---

## The Commercial Insight (Why This Matters)

This is a **sellable product on Day 1** because:

- Value is realised immediately
- The learner leaves with something they can use
- The experience cannot be replicated by watching content

It answers the buyer question:

> “What exactly am I paying for?”

Answer:

> *A constrained decision environment that restores judgement under pressure — in one sitting.*

---

## Final Test

If you removed:
- all videos
- all theory
- all future modules

…but kept these five screens,

**the product would still work**.

That is the correct Day‑1 scope.

*This document should guide UX design, technical scoping, and go‑to‑market positioning for the BMAD v6 Training MVP.*
