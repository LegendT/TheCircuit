# BMAD v6 Training – Absolute Minimum Viable Programme (Refined Scope)

This document defines the **irreducible core** of the BMAD v6 Training Programme.

Its purpose is to answer one question only:

> **“What is the smallest thing we can deliver that reliably restores judgement under scrutiny?”**

This refinement pressure-tests the original 5-step MVP against everything uncovered in discovery, validation, metrics, buyer/user dynamics, and leading-indicator analysis.

The conclusion is not that the scope was wrong — but that it must be **hardened further to survive real-world misuse**.

---

## The Original 5 Moves (Restated)

1. **Eligibility** — Should this decision be structured at all?
2. **Declare** — What decision am *I* making?
3. **Sufficiency** — What is enough to decide responsibly?
4. **Artefact** — What minimal record makes this defensible?
5. **Stop / Go** — Commit and accept consequence

These five moves are not a workflow.
They are a **judgement circuit**.

---

## What the Discovery Work Actually Changed

**The sequence is still correct.**

What changed is our understanding of *where it breaks*.

Discovery showed that failure does not come from missing steps.
It comes from:
- Soft gates
- Proxy authority
- Excess optionality

Therefore the MVP does not need expansion.
It needs **enforcement**.

---

## Refined Design Constraints (New)

For the MVP to work, each move must now meet a stricter condition.

---

## 1. Eligibility Is a Kill Switch, Not a Filter

**Original framing risk**:
Eligibility read as a warm-up question.

**Refined position**:
Eligibility is a **termination condition**.

Minimum viable behaviour:
- Learner must explicitly state *why this decision deserves structure*
- Learner must also name at least one decision that does **not** qualify

Failure to disqualify anything = misuse.

If eligibility fails, the programme ends.

---

## 2. Declaration Forbids Proxy Authority

**Original framing risk**:
Learners could still hide behind tools or consensus.

**Refined position**:
Declaration is invalid unless:
- It is written in first-person
- It includes explicit ownership of consequence

Disallowed patterns:
- “The framework suggests…”
- “AI recommended…”
- “We decided…” (without role clarity)

A declaration without ownership is a null step.

---

## 3. Sufficiency Is the Core Competence (Not a Phase)

**Key discovery insight**:
Learners do not lack structure.
They lack stopping confidence.

**Refined position**:
Sufficiency must be:
- Named explicitly
- Justified in relation to risk
- Revisited before stopping

If sufficiency is weak, no later step can compensate.

---

## 4. Artefact Is Constrained by Defensibility Time

**Original framing risk**:
Artefacts bloated quietly.

**Refined position**:
The artefact is valid only if:
- It can be defended in under **two minutes**
- It contains:
  - The decision
  - The sufficiency rationale
  - The rejected alternative

Anything more is distortion.

---

## 5. Stop / Go Is a Commitment Act

**Original framing risk**:
Learners delayed commitment.

**Refined position**:
Stop / Go requires:
- Explicit commitment
- Named downside
- Acceptance of consequence

No hedging language.
No “next steps” padding.

---

## What Is Still Deliberately Excluded

Despite pressure, the MVP still excludes:

- Community
- Mentorship
- Extended theory
- Templates libraries
- Dashboards or progress metrics

All of these reintroduce external authority.

The MVP is designed to stand **alone, in silence**.

---

## The Absolute Minimum (Final Form)

If a learner can perform these five moves **once**, on one real decision, with these constraints met:

- They have stopped over-working
- They have owned a decision
- They can defend it briefly
- They have accepted the risk

Then the core problem is solved.

Everything else is optional.

---

## The Irreversibility Test

Ask:

> *After doing this once, could the learner ever fully return to their previous decision behaviour?*

If the answer is *yes*, the MVP is too soft.

Based on discovery, the hardened 5-move MVP passes this test.

---

## Final Position (Refined)

The minimum viable programme is not minimal content.

It is **maximal constraint around minimal moves**.

The scope has not expanded.
It has become harder to misuse.

That hardness is the product.

---

*This document should be treated as the non-negotiable boundary for the BMAD v6 Training MVP. Any addition must prove it strengthens constraint and irreversibility — not convenience or comfort.*
