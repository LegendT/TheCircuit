# Free BMAD Content Landscape

This document inventories **what BMAD-related content is already available for free**, where it lives, and what it does (and does not) cover.

Its purpose is to:
- Avoid duplicating free material in paid training
- Clearly define the **boundary between free BMAD resources and paid BMAD training**
- Inform tiering, certification design, and value differentiation

## 1. Official BMAD Method Repository (Free)

**Source**: BMAD Method GitHub repository

### What is available
- Full open-source BMAD Method framework (MIT licensed)
- Agent definitions and personas
- Guided workflows across analysis, planning, solutioning, and implementation
- Installation and usage instructions
- Reference documentation (agents, workflows, modules, testing)

### What it does well
- Canonical source of truth for BMAD
- Transparent and inspectable
- Excellent for experienced practitioners

### Where it falls short
- Assumes high self-direction and prior experience
- Limited pedagogical structure
- No learning path or progression model
- No certification, verification, or assessment
- No guidance on *how much* BMAD to apply in different contexts

## 2. Official Documentation Website (Free)

**Source**: docs.bmad-method.org

### What is available
- Getting started tutorials
- How-to guides (installation, upgrades, fixes)
- Concept explanations (workflows, agent conflicts, solutioning)
- Reference material

### What it does well
- Structured documentation
- Clear explanations of mechanics
- Good onboarding for technically confident users

### Where it falls short
- Documentation-first, not learner-first
- No scenario-based learning
- No assessment or feedback loops
- Not optimised for non-technical or mixed-discipline audiences

---

## 3. Free Video Content (YouTube & Community Videos)

### What is available
- Installation walkthroughs
- Agent and workflow demos
- Live streams and recorded talks
- Community explanations of specific features

### What it does well
- Low barrier to entry
- Visual demonstrations
- Helpful for initial exploration

### Where it falls short
- Fragmented and non-linear
- No canonical learning sequence
- Rapidly becomes outdated
- No verification of understanding

---

## 4. Community Blog Posts & Tutorials (Free)

### What is available
- Medium articles and blog posts explaining BMAD concepts
- Personal walkthroughs and interpretations
- Practical tips from early adopters

### What it does well
- Human explanations
- Real-world anecdotes
- Helpful clarifications for beginners

### Where it falls short
- Inconsistent quality
- Often opinionated or incomplete
- Not version-aware
- Not authoritative or maintained

---

## 5. Community Implementations & Skills (Free)

### What is available
- BMAD skill packs for tools like Claude Code
- Example repos showing BMAD in practice
- Experimental integrations

### What it does well
- Shows BMAD in real environments
- Useful for hands-on learners
- Encourages experimentation

### Where it falls short
- Experimental and unstable
- No guarantee of correctness
- No alignment with best practices
- No support or certification

## Cross-cutting Characteristics of Free BMAD Content

Across all free sources:
- BMAD is **available**, but not **taught**
- Knowledge is **descriptive**, not **instructional**
- Learning is **self-directed**, not scaffolded
- There is **no assessment, verification, or certification**
- There is **no versioned learning path**

---

## Strategic Implications for Paid Training

The existence of rich free content means the paid BMAD v6 Training Programme should:

- Avoid re-teaching basic mechanics
- Focus on:
  - Decision-making
  - Contextual application
  - Failure modes
  - Scenario-based execution
- Provide:
  - Structured learning paths
  - Clear progression and mastery levels
  - Verification and certification
  - Version-aware updates and re-certification

---

## Boundary Statement (Internal)

> Free BMAD content explains *what exists*.
> Paid BMAD training teaches *how to use it well, when to use it, and how to prove you can*.

*This document is intended for internal product strategy, curriculum design, and positioning decisions for the BMAD v6 Training Programme.*
