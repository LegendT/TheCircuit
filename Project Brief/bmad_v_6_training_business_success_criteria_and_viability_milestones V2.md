# BMAD v6 Training – Business Success Criteria and Viability Milestones (Refined)

This document is a **commercial integrity stress test** for the BMAD v6 Training Programme.

Its purpose is not to define growth targets, but to answer a harder question:

> **“Is this working as a business *without corrupting the method*?”**

This refinement tightens success definitions, removes residual ambiguity, and makes failure conditions more explicit.

---

## What Was Slightly Overstated

### 1. Revenue bands risked sounding prescriptive

**Original risk**: Quoting revenue ranges (£5k–£15k, £75k–£150k) could be misread as goals rather than *diagnostic thresholds*.

**Refinement**:
- Revenue figures are **contextual sanity checks**, not targets
- The signal is *coverage + willingness*, not magnitude

**Design implication**: A smaller revenue number with clean reuse beats a larger number driven by hype.

---

### 2. Cohort size implied more structure than necessary

**Original risk**: Even modest cohort framing can imply batch-led optimisation.

**Refinement**:
- Success does not require formal cohorts
- What matters is *repeat calibrated use*, not synchronised learning

**Design implication**: Do not force cadence where asynchronous reuse is already occurring.

---

### 3. Support burden framed too narrowly

**Original risk**: Treating low support load as purely positive.

**Refinement**:
- Zero questions can signal disengagement
- The right signal is **low mechanical support, but thoughtful decision questions**

**Design implication**: Track *question quality*, not volume alone.

---

## What Was Missing

### 1. Explicit kill / pause criteria

**Missing element**: Clear conditions under which to stop or redesign.

**Refinement**:
At 3 months, pause or redesign if:
- Buyers are curious but not reusing
- Learners ask for more content instead of clearer decisions
- Revenue depends on discounts or urgency tactics

These are structural misalignments, not marketing issues.

---

### 2. Time cost as a first-class metric

**Missing element**: Founder / operator time.

**Refinement**:
- The business is failing if it requires:
  - Constant explanation
  - High-touch reassurance
  - Manual correction of misuse

Even with revenue, this indicates the model does not hold.

---

### 3. Drift detection over time

**Missing element**: How to tell if success is *corrupting* the method.

**Refinement**:
Early drift signals include:
- Pressure to add more metrics
- Requests for leaderboards or progress tracking
- Buyer requests to modify pedagogy for reporting

**Design implication**: These are not feature requests; they are integrity warnings.

## Refined 3-Month Horizon: Proof of Viability

The 3-month question is:

> **“Would this survive without my evangelism?”**

---

### 3-Month Success Conditions (All Required)

#### 1. Correct Buyer Fit

- Majority of buyers have real decision exposure
- Purchases occur without heavy persuasion

---

#### 2. Reuse Without Prompting

- Learners apply BMAD to a second decision
- Use occurs outside the programme context

---

#### 3. Quiet Pull Into Real Work

- Artefacts are shared upward or sideways
- BMAD language appears in work conversations

---

#### 4. Revenue Covers Reality

- Platform + maintenance costs covered
- Founder time compensated at a *defensive* rate

Magnitude secondary; sufficiency primary.

---

#### 5. Sustainable Attention Load

- Fewer than ~10–15% require mechanical support
- Questions are about judgement, not usage

---

### 3-Month Failure Signals (Explicit)

Pause or redesign if:
- Learners finish but do not reuse
- Buyers ask for proof instead of results
- Support demand trends upward

---

## Refined 12-Month Horizon: Proof of Sustainability

The 12-month question becomes:

> **“Is this now a practice people rely on, not a programme they completed?”**

---

### 12-Month Sustainability Conditions

#### 1. Clear Product Ladder (Earned)

- Advanced tiers exist because demand pulled them
- Not because roadmap promised them

---

#### 2. Organisational Adoption Signals

- Team or agency purchases
- Internal reuse without re-training

---

#### 3. Repeat Revenue With Low Friction

- Renewals or follow-ons without re-selling
- 30–50% of early buyers return in some form

---

#### 4. Defensible Revenue Band

- Revenue sufficient to:
  - Maintain content
  - Maintain infrastructure
  - Add *selective* human roles

Growth without added distortion.

---

#### 5. Method Integrity Under Load

- No increase in performative metrics
- Calibration outcomes stable
- Buyer pressure resisted successfully

---

## The Minimum Viable Business Test (Refined)

If you need the simplest possible test:

> **“People with real decision risk pay, reuse without prompting, and bring BMAD into their work — without us having to chase them.”**

If any clause fails, the business is not yet viable.

---

## What to Optimise For (Final Order)

1. Buyer exposure fit
2. Reuse under consequence
3. Quiet organisational pull
4. Revenue sufficiency
5. Only then, scale

This order is non-negotiable.

---

## Final Integrity Question

Every business decision should answer:

> *“Does this increase the number of defensible decisions being made — or just the number of people touching the programme?”*

Only the first produces durable success.

---

*This refined document should act as a kill-switch and compass for commercial decisions related to the BMAD v6 Training Programme.*
