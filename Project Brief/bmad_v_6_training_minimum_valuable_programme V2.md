# BMAD v6 Training – Minimum Valuable Programme (Refined)

This document defines a **critically refined version** of the Minimum Valuable Programme (MVP) for BMAD training.

The goal is to preserve **maximum behavioural impact** while further reducing:
- Cognitive load
- Ambiguity
- Support burden
- Risk of learner drift

This version tightens gates, clarifies failure conditions, and makes value delivery *measurable*, not inferred.

---

## Design Test: What Must Still Be True

For this programme to deliver real value (and not collapse into content), **all four must remain true**:

1. The learner works on a **real, current project**
2. The learner makes an explicit **process sufficiency decision**
3. The learner produces **one constrained artefact**
4. The learner makes a **defensible stop / go decision**

If any of these are removed or softened, the programme loses integrity.

---

## Programme Shape (Tightened)

- **Duration**: 5–7 days (flexible window)
- **Total effort**: 2.5–3.5 hours
- **Format**: Fully asynchronous
- **Support model**: Automated checks + optional human review at upgrade point

This is intentionally short. Constraint is the teaching mechanism.

---

## Refined Learner Flow

### Step 0 — Eligibility Gate (≈5 minutes)

**New addition**: Not everyone should start.

The learner must confirm:
- They have an active or imminent piece of work
- They can commit ~30 minutes/day for one week

**Fail outcome**:
- Deferred start
- Clear guidance on when to return

This prevents immediate drop-off and resentment.

---

### Step 1 — Declare a Real Project (≈20 minutes)

**Refinement**: Shorter, sharper, no narrative.

The learner must:
- Name the project
- State the decision they are currently stuck on
- State the cost of being wrong

**Required output**:
- 3 bullet points, max 20 words each

**Auto-fail conditions**:
- Hypothetical projects
- Vague problem statements

---

### Step 2 — Process Sufficiency Decision (≈40 minutes)

This remains the **core value**.

The learner must explicitly decide:
- What BMAD components are *mandatory*
- What components are *optional*
- What components are *excluded*

**Required output**:
- One-page **Process Sufficiency Decision Record**

**Refinement**:
- Introduce a forced trade-off question:
  > “What would break if you applied full BMAD here?”

This prevents over-application.

---

### Step 3 — Single Constrained Artefact (≈45 minutes)

**Refinement**: Reduce choice to reduce hesitation.

The learner produces:
- A lean `/product-brief`

**Hard constraints**:
- Maximum 500 words
- Explicit non-goals section
- No diagrams

**Auto-fail conditions**:
- Exceeding word count
- Missing non-goals

This enforces discipline immediately.

---

### Step 4 — AI Disagreement Exercise (≈25 minutes)

**Refinement**: Make disagreement non-optional.

The learner must:
- Run the artefact through AI
- Reject *at least one* AI recommendation
- Explain why accepting it would be harmful

**Required output**:
- One-paragraph AI disagreement note

This hard-codes judgement as the skill being trained.

---

### Step 5 — Stop / Go Decision Gate (≈20 minutes)

**Refinement**: Narrow the decision.

The learner must choose:
- **Stop now**, or
- **Proceed with constraints**

They must justify the decision using:
- The original sufficiency decision
- Artefact quality

**Required output**:
- Decision record (template-enforced)

---

## What Changed (Critique Summary)

### 1. Reduced optionality
- Fewer choices = less hesitation
- One artefact, not many

### 2. Earlier filtering
- Eligibility gate prevents weak starts

### 3. Stronger failure signals
- Auto-fail conditions remove subjectivity

### 4. Clearer value proof
- Learners leave with:
  - A scope decision
  - A constrained artefact
  - A defensible decision

These are professional outputs, not learning traces.

---

## What This Still Does NOT Do (Intentionally)

- ❌ No certification
- ❌ No claims of mastery
- ❌ No deep tooling instruction
- ❌ No enterprise promises

Those belong in later tiers.

---

## Commercial & Structural Implications

This refined MVP:
- Can be priced confidently as a paid product
- Has low marginal support cost
- Acts as a **mandatory gateway** to advanced training
- Filters out learners who want content, not judgement

---

## Final Integrity Check

If a learner completes this and cannot:
- Explain why they scoped BMAD the way they did, or
- Defend stopping or proceeding,

then the programme has failed — not the learner.

*This refined Minimum Valuable Programme is the smallest unit of BMAD training that reliably produces behavioural change and professional judgement.*
