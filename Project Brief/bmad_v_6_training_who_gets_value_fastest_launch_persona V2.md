# BMAD v6 Training – Who Gets Value Fastest (Launch Persona, Refined)

This document is a **launch-persona stress test** for the BMAD v6 Training Programme.

Its purpose is to ensure the chosen launch persona:
- Experiences value *faster than anyone else*
- Reaches the “click” moment with minimal facilitation
- Produces credible external proof of value
- Pulls the method into wider adoption through action, not evangelism

This refinement tightens claims, removes subtle hero-worship, and clarifies *why* some people get value faster — and where that advantage stops.

---

## What Was Slightly Overstated

### 1. Speed of value was framed as near-universal within agency leads

**Original risk**: Implicitly suggesting most agency technical leads will “get it” quickly.

**Refinement**:
- Agency leads only get value fast **after a trigger event**.
- Pre-trigger leads often behave like framework collectors or throughput optimisers.

**Design implication**: Launch messaging must explicitly reference *recent scrutiny or failure*, not generic leadership.

---

### 2. “They already think in trade-offs” needed qualification

**Original risk**: Assuming trade-off thinking equals calibration readiness.

**Refinement**:
- Many leads think in trade-offs but still:
  - Over-document to appear rigorous
  - Under-document to appear fast

BMAD lands fastest where trade-offs are already **defended publicly**, not merely considered privately.

---

### 3. Action speed ≠ conceptual clarity

**Original risk**: Equating fast action with fast understanding.

**Refinement**:
- Some leads adopt BMAD artefacts quickly but misuse them
- Early misuse often looks like over-formalisation

**Design implication**: Early wins must be *constrained* to prevent performative adoption.

---

## What Was Missing

### 1. The role of prior failure (explicit)

The strongest predictor of fast value is not role, but **recent embarrassment or near-miss**.

Examples:
- Client asks “why did you do it this way?” and the answer is weak
- A rework exposes fragile reasoning
- A senior review challenges assumptions

**Refinement**: Fastest-value personas are *post-failure*, not merely senior.

---

### 2. The ceiling of fast value

Fast comprehension does not equal long-term adoption.

**Refinement**:
- Agency leads get value fast
- But plateau quickly unless:
  - BMAD is socialised into team practice
  - Artefacts become shared, not personal

**Design implication**: The launch persona is ideal for entry, not sufficient for depth.

---

### 3. Who actually evangelises

**Original risk**: Assuming agency leads advocate outwardly.

**Refinement**:
- They rarely evangelise publicly
- They signal adoption by:
  - Quiet reuse
  - Internal mandate
  - Pulling others into the method

**Design implication**: Measure success via *reuse*, not testimonials.

---

## Refined Fastest-Value Persona

### The Post-Scrutiny Delivery Lead

Not “agency lead” in general — but:

> **A delivery or technical lead who has recently had their decisions questioned by a client, peer, or superior, and lacked a satisfying defence.**

---

## Why This Persona Gets Value Fastest

### 1. They are already in consequence

- Reputation is in play
- Revenue or trust is at risk

BMAD is experienced as **damage control**, not learning.

---

### 2. They need defensibility *now*, not optimisation later

They are not looking to:
- Explore AI
- Improve productivity

They are looking to:
- Restore narrative control
- Reduce future exposure

---

### 3. They can apply BMAD the same day

They have:
- Live work
- Imminent reviews
- Authority to change how work is framed

Immediate application accelerates understanding.

---

## The Real “Click” Moment (Refined)

The click is not excitement.

It is the moment they realise:

> “This gives me a way to justify restraint *without sounding defensive or slow*.”

At that point, BMAD becomes:
- A conversational shield
- A decision audit trail
- A shared reference point

---

## Secondary Fast-Value Personas (Clarified)

### Senior ICs (Post-Visibility Spike)

They get value quickly **after**:
- Increased scrutiny
- Loss of plausible deniability

Adoption is quieter and more internal.

---

### Indie Builders (Post-Oscillation Fatigue)

They get value once:
- Repeated restarts become intolerable
- Completeness is abandoned in favour of sufficiency

Value is strong but slower to arrive.

---

## Poor Launch Personas (Reinforced)

- AI tourists (no stakes)
- Throughput-only managers (avoid explanation)
- Framework collectors (avoid judgement)

These groups do not reach the click moment reliably.

---

## Refined Launch Recommendation

### Launch Persona

> **Post-scrutiny delivery and technical leads with live client or stakeholder exposure.**

### Launch Design Implications

- Reference recent review, challenge, or embarrassment explicitly
- Deliver a first win that is externally defensible
- Constrain early use to avoid performative over-structure
- Optimise for *reuse under pressure*, not delight

---

## Final Launch Test

If this persona does not say:

> “This lets me defend my decisions without over-explaining,”

within the first week, the programme is not launch-ready.
