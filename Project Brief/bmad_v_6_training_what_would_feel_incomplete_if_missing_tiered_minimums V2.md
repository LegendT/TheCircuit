# BMAD v6 Training – What Would Feel Incomplete If Missing (Refined Tiered Minimums)

This document defines **the irreducible signals of completeness** that prevent BMAD v6 Training from feeling like “a PDF with aspirations.”

Its purpose is not feature prioritisation.
It is **credibility preservation**.

The refinement below tightens user psychology, removes a few hidden assumptions, and sharpens the boundary between *what must exist* and *what must not*.

---

## What Was Slightly Overstated

### 1. “Users” were treated as uniform within tiers

**Original risk**: Assuming consistency of expectation inside each tier.

**Refinement**:
- What feels *incomplete* is driven less by role than by **decision exposure**
- A senior IC in Tier 1 may expect more rigour than a junior team member in Tier 3

**Design implication**:
Completeness signals must be **experience-based**, not persona-based.

---

### 2. History was framed as a Tier‑2 requirement only

**Original risk**: Treating decision history as an upgrade feature.

**Refinement**:
- Even Tier‑1 users expect *evidence that something happened*
- Lack of persistence undermines seriousness

**Design implication**:
- Tier‑1 requires *session persistence* (a saved artefact)
- Tier‑2 adds *comparative continuity* (multiple decisions over time)

---

### 3. “Shareability” risked being read as collaboration

**Original risk**: Buyers may infer multi‑author workflows.

**Refinement**:
- Sharing is **directional and static**, not collaborative
- Ownership must never be diluted

**Design implication**:
Sharing = visibility, not participation.

---

## What Was Missing

### 1. The emotional completeness test

**Missing element**: Users judge completeness emotionally before rationally.

A programme feels incomplete if the learner leaves thinking:
- “I’m not sure if that counted”
- “I think I did it, but…”
- “What happens now?”

**Refinement**:
Completeness requires **psychological finality**, not just functional exit.

---

### 2. The buyer’s silent checklist

**Missing element**: What buyers look for before they articulate requirements.

Buyers silently check:
- Is there a system, not just content?
- Is there evidence of constraint?
- Is there a defensible output?

If any are missing, the programme feels amateur — regardless of learning quality.

---

### 3. The anti‑feature problem

**Missing element**: Some features create incompleteness by their presence.

Examples:
- Progress bars (imply unfinished state)
- “Next module” prompts (undermine finality)
- Community links (signal reliance on others)

**Refinement**:
Completeness is as much about *what is absent* as what is present.

---

## Refined Completeness Signals (Universal)

Across all tiers, a programme feels complete only if **all four signals are present**:

1. **Forced action** (a real decision is required)
2. **System pushback** (constraints resist over‑work)
3. **Persistent artefact** (something remains afterwards)
4. **Psychological finality** (the learner knows it is done)

If any are missing, users describe the experience as “interesting” rather than “useful.”

---

## Tier‑by‑Tier Refined Minimums

---

## Tier 1 – Individual (Self‑Directed)

### Completeness failures if missing

- No enforced decision entry
- No hard constraints (character limits, blocked language)
- No saved artefact
- No explicit end state

### Refined minimum

> **One real decision, taken to completion, producing a saved artefact and a felt sense of finality.**

Without all four, Tier‑1 collapses into reading.

---

## Tier 2 – Advanced Individual / Power User

### Completeness failures if missing

- Inability to see past decisions
- No clear distinction between completion and reconsideration
- No reminder of original sufficiency boundary

### Refined minimum

> **Repeatable use of the same constrained environment, with memory and protection against hindsight rewriting.**

Tier‑2 is about *stability over time*, not sophistication.

---

## Tier 3 – Agency / Team

### Completeness failures if missing

- Artefacts cannot travel outside the system
- Ownership is unclear to observers
- No translation layer for non‑users

### Refined minimum

> **Decisions that can be shared, read, and trusted by others without explanation or participation.**

Anything collaborative at this stage weakens trust.

---

## Tier 4 – Organisation / Certification

### Completeness failures if missing

- No clear sufficiency bar
- No verification mechanism
- No audit trail

### Refined minimum

> **A verifiable sufficiency gate that establishes legitimacy without introducing ranking or performance optics.**

Legitimacy, not pedagogy, is the driver here.

---

## What Still Does *Not* Create Incompleteness

Across all tiers, users do **not** experience absence of these as gaps:

- Videos
- Case libraries
- Community spaces
- Gamification
- Progress dashboards

Their absence does not reduce trust.
Their presence often does.

---

## The Refined “PDF Test”

At any tier, ask:

> *“Could this be replaced by a static document without losing behavioural force or emotional finality?”*

If yes, something essential is missing.

Usually one of:
- Constraint
- Persistence
- Irreversibility

---

## Final Position (Refined)

A programme feels complete when:
- The learner is forced to act
- The system resists them appropriately
- Something remains afterwards
- And nothing pulls them forward unnecessarily

Completeness is **experienced**, not described.

*This refined document should act as a scope‑defence and credibility checklist when designing tiers, pricing, and feature sets for the BMAD v6 Training Programme.*
