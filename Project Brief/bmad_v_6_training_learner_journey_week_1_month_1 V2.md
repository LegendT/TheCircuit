# BMAD v6 Training – Learner Journey (Refined)

This document defines a **refined, critique-informed learner journey** for the BMAD v6 Training Programme. It focuses on **behaviour, evidence, and gating**, ensuring learners *do work*, demonstrate competence, and build durable habits.

Key refinements applied:
- Clear **timeboxes** and **effort expectations**
- Explicit **failure modes** and recovery paths
- **Evidence-based outputs** (what must exist)
- **Gates** that block progress without mastery
- Reduced cognitive overload in Week 1

---

## Design Principles

- **Action over consumption**: every step produces artefacts.
- **Sufficiency over completeness**: stop early when appropriate.
- **Constraint is pedagogy**: learners are interrupted on purpose.
- **Evidence beats intention**: progress requires proof.
- **Recovery is allowed**: failure triggers coaching, not expulsion.

---

# WEEK 1 — Orientation → Control → First Win

**Outcome goal**: The learner achieves one small, real, defensible win using BMAD on their own work.

**Effort**: ~30–45 minutes/day

---

## Day 1 — System Onboarding & Baseline

### What the learner does (30–45 mins)
- Sets up account and identity
- Declares role context (solo / agency / team)
- Selects **one real project** (must be active or imminent)
- Completes a short execution diagnostic
- Installs BMAD or connects to a provided environment

### Evidence required
- Declared project context
- Baseline problem statement (≤200 words)
- Working BMAD environment (validated automatically)

### Common failure modes
- Over-scoping the project
- Choosing a hypothetical problem

**Recovery**: forced project re-scope prompt

---

## Day 2 — Decision Before Method

**Core lesson**: BMAD is scoped, not applied wholesale.

### What the learner does (30 mins)
- Runs a guided **Process Sufficiency Exercise**
- Decides what to:
  - Apply strictly
  - Keep lightweight
  - Exclude entirely
- Documents trade-offs

### Evidence required
- A BMAD Scope Decision (1 page max)
- Written justification for exclusions

### Gate
- Cannot proceed without a defensible scope decision

---

## Day 3 — First Structured Output (Lean by Design)

### What the learner does (45 mins)
- Runs `/product-brief` on their real project
- Is interrupted once sufficiency is reached
- Explicitly lists non-goals

### Evidence required
- Product brief (≤2 pages)
- Non-goals list
- Early success signals

### Failure modes
- Over-analysis
- Generic language

**Recovery**: enforced rewrite with tighter constraints

---

## Day 4 — AI as Collaborator

### What the learner does (30 mins)
- Runs guided agent interactions
- Challenges AI assumptions
- Performs adversarial self-review

### Evidence required
- Revised artefact
- Reflection: “What the AI got wrong and why” (≤150 words)

---

## Day 5 — Validation Gate

### What the learner does (30 mins)
- Runs a quality gate
- Makes a go / no-go decision
- Justifies stopping or proceeding

### Evidence required
- Decision record
- Rationale tied to initial scope

### End-of-week capability check
- Can scope BMAD appropriately
- Can stop work early
- Can defend a decision

---

# MONTH 1 — Repetition, Depth, Credibility

**Outcome goal**: The learner demonstrates repeatable, defensible execution habits.

---

## Week 2 — Disciplined Planning

### Focus
- Escalation *only when justified*

### What the learner does
- Runs `/create-prd` selectively
- Applies non-functional constraints
- Identifies and documents risks

### Evidence required
- PRD or decision not to create one
- Risk surface summary

---

## Week 3 — Architecture & Trade-offs

### Focus
- Decisions, not diagrams

### What the learner does
- Runs `/create-architecture`
- Documents assumptions and reversibility

### Evidence required
- Architecture decision log
- Explicit trade-offs

---

## Week 4 — Verification & Professional Readiness

### Focus
- Credibility under scrutiny

### What the learner does
- Runs verification workflows
- Performs adversarial review
- Practices explaining decisions

### Evidence required
- Traceable execution trail
- Readiness self-assessment

---

## End-of-Month Capability Profile

By the end of Month 1, the learner can:
- Decide how much process is appropriate
- Use AI without surrendering judgement
- Produce artefacts that withstand scrutiny
- Explain *why* decisions were made
- Stop bad work early and confidently

---

## Implications for Certification

- Progress requires **evidence**, not attendance
- Gates are enforced
- Failure triggers remediation paths
- Certification measures **repeatable execution**, not recall

---

*This refined journey should be treated as a living specification for curriculum design, UX flows, assessment logic, and certification standards.*
