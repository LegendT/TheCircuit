# BMAD v6 Training – Absolute Minimum Viable Programme (Revalidated Scope)

This document revalidates the **absolute minimum** required to solve the core problem BMAD v6 Training exists to address:

> **Restoring judgement under scrutiny — the ability to make, stop, and defend decisions without outsourcing authority.**

It pressure-tests the previously defined **5-step MVP programme** against everything we’ve learned through discovery, segmentation, metrics, buyer/user analysis, and early success indicators.

The goal is not elegance.
It is sufficiency.

---

## The Original 5-Step MVP (Restated)

1. **Eligibility** – Is this decision worth structured attention?
2. **Declare** – What decision is actually being made?
3. **Sufficiency** – What is enough to decide responsibly?
4. **Artefact** – What record makes this decision defensible?
5. **Stop / Go** – Commit, stop, and accept consequence

This sequence was designed to:
- Interrupt overthinking
- Prevent framework sprawl
- Produce a defensible outcome quickly

---

## Has Discovery Changed the Core Scope?

**Short answer: No.**

The 5-step structure still cleanly targets the calibration deficit.

However, discovery *has* clarified:
- Where the programme is vulnerable to misuse
- What must be emphasised vs merely present
- What *must not* be added

The scope is correct.
The **emphasis** needs sharpening.

---

## What the Discovery Work Confirmed

Across all documents, the same core truths repeated:

- Learners fail when they seek reassurance
- Buyers distort outcomes when given metrics
- Early value appears as *second use*, not completion
- Stopping is the hardest and most valuable behaviour

The original 5 steps already address these — but not all with equal force.

---

## What Needs Refinement (Not Expansion)

### 1. Eligibility Must Be Ruthless

**Risk discovered**:
Learners try to apply BMAD everywhere.

**Refinement**:
Eligibility is not a warm-up.
It is a **hard gate**.

Minimum requirement:
- Explicit permission to *not* use BMAD
- Clear examples of ineligible decisions

If eligibility fails, the programme should end.

---

### 2. Declare Must Forbid Proxy Decisions

**Risk discovered**:
Learners hide behind AI suggestions, frameworks, or consensus.

**Refinement**:
Declaration must:
- Require first-person ownership
- Ban language like “the framework suggests”

A declaration without ownership is invalid.

---

### 3. Sufficiency Is the Core Skill (Not a Step)

**Discovery insight**:
Sufficiency, not structure, is what learners lack.

**Refinement**:
Sufficiency must:
- Be named as the *central move*
- Be revisited explicitly

If learners internalise only one thing, it should be sufficiency.

---

### 4. Artefact Must Be Minimal by Design

**Risk discovered**:
Learners over-produce artefacts.

**Refinement**:
The artefact must be:
- Intentionally small
- Actively constrained

Any artefact that cannot be defended in under 2 minutes is too large.

---

### 5. Stop / Go Must Be Explicit and Final

**Discovery insight**:
Learners delay commitment even after clarity.

**Refinement**:
Stop / Go must:
- Require a declared commitment
- Include a named consequence

No soft landings.

---

## What Has *Not* Been Added (Deliberately)

Through discovery, many tempting additions were rejected:

- No community
- No mentoring
- No extended theory
- No case libraries
- No metrics dashboards

All would weaken judgement by introducing external authority.

---

## The Absolute Minimum Viable Programme (Final Form)

The MVP remains **five moves**, but with clarified intent:

1. **Eligibility** – Decide *whether to decide*
2. **Declare** – Own the decision in first-person terms
3. **Sufficiency** – Name what is enough and why
4. **Artefact** – Record the decision at minimum defensible size
5. **Stop / Go** – Commit and accept consequence

If a learner can perform these five moves on one real decision,
**the core problem is solved**.

Everything else is optional.

---

## The Hard Test of Sufficiency

Ask:

> *If we removed everything except these five moves, would learners still regain trust in their judgement?*

Based on discovery, the answer is **yes**.

If anything else is added before this works in the wild, the product is at risk.

---

## Final Position

The MVP scope has not expanded.

It has **hardened**.

The absolute minimum is not more content.
It is **stronger constraints around fewer moves**.

That is the product.

---

*This document should be treated as the non-negotiable scope boundary for the BMAD v6 Training MVP. Any addition must prove it strengthens — not softens — these five moves.*
