# BMAD v6 Training – Segmentation: Shared Pain, Distinct Journeys (Refined)

This document is a **segmentation stress-test** for the BMAD v6 Training Programme.

Its purpose is to ensure that segmentation decisions:
- Increase conversion and retention
- Reduce cognitive and emotional mismatch
- Preserve the conceptual integrity of BMAD

This refinement sharpens boundaries, corrects mild overreach, and makes divergence points operational rather than rhetorical.

## What Was Slightly Overstated

### 1. “Shared pain” risks sounding broader than it is

**Original risk**: Treating the calibration deficit as something *everyone* meaningfully experiences.

**Refinement**:
- The calibration deficit is **not universal**.
- It is acute only where:
  - Work is visible
  - Decisions are questioned
  - Failure has consequence

**Design implication**: Do not present shared pain as a general condition of AI use. It is a condition of **accountable work**.

---

### 2. Journeys were described more clearly than the fork point

**Original risk**: Distinct journeys are named, but the *moment of divergence* is implicit.

**Refinement**:
- Segmentation should not happen at sign-up
- It should happen **after the learner has experienced calibration once**

**Design implication**: Premature segmentation increases dropout and weakens the shared mental model.

---

## What Was Missing

### 1. Budget as a first-class constraint

The original document underplayed how strongly **budget ceiling** shapes journey viability.

**Refinement**:
- Segmentation must explicitly account for:
  - Personal discretionary spend (solo / indie)
  - Expense-justified spend (agency / org)

**Design implication**: The same journey cannot simply be priced differently; scope and support expectations must change.

---

### 2. Time horizon differences

Different segments tolerate different timelines for payoff.

**Refinement**:
- Agency and accountability holders need *immediate defensibility*
- Solo creatives tolerate slower payoff if cognitive load drops

**Design implication**: Early wins must be framed differently, even if structurally similar.

---

### 3. Psychological safety requirements

The original segmentation assumed similar tolerance for exposure.

**Refinement**:
- Solo operators often lack external validation
- Agency leads are over-exposed already

**Design implication**:
- Solo journeys need stronger containment and reassurance
- Agency journeys need speed and proof, not comfort

---

## Refined Segmentation Model

### Unify on the *Problem*, Not the *Persona*

BMAD has:
- One calibration problem
- One decision-centric mental model

This must remain non-negotiable.

---

### Diverge on Four Axes (Operational)

Instead of persona labels, divergence should be driven by four measurable axes:

1. **Exposure to external judgement** (low → high)
2. **Budget control** (personal → organisational)
3. **Time-to-value tolerance** (short → long)
4. **Psychological containment needs** (low → high)

Each learner can be placed on these axes after the MVP.

## Refined Segment Journeys

### Segment A: High Exposure / Organisational Spend

(Agency leads, delivery heads, senior ICs with external scrutiny)

**Primary optimisation**: Defensibility now

- Accelerated onboarding
- Immediate application to live work
- Heavy emphasis on decision records and reviewable artefacts
- Clear upgrade path to team rollout

---

### Segment B: Low Exposure / Personal Spend

(Solo creatives, indie builders)

**Primary optimisation**: Cognitive relief without collapse

- Slower pacing
- Harder constraints to prevent overwork
- Strong permission to stop and simplify
- Minimal artefact surface

---

### Segment C: Medium Exposure / Limited Authority

(Accountability holders inside organisations)

**Primary optimisation**: Risk translation

- Artefacts designed for sceptical third parties
- Language for explaining restraint
- Framing BMAD as stabilisation, not control

---

## What Not to Segment On (Reinforced)

- Industry
- Job title alone
- Tool preference
- AI maturity rhetoric

These are weak predictors of willingness to pay and success.

---

## Structural Recommendation (Refined)

### One Entry Point, One Calibration Experience

- Single Minimum Valuable Programme
- Shared language and artefacts

---

### Post-MVP Branching by Axis, Not Persona

After calibration, branching should adjust:
- Pace
- Artefact strictness
- Review intensity
- Price and support

Without altering the core method.

---

## Final Position (Refined)

BMAD should be positioned as:

> **One method for calibrated judgement under scrutiny, adaptable across contexts without fragmentation.**

Segmentation is essential — but only **after** the learner understands calibration.

Premature divergence weakens the method.
Unified grounding strengthens every downstream journey.
