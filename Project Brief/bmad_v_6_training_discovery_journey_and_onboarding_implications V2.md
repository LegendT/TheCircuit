# BMAD v6 Training – Discovery Journey and Onboarding Implications (Refined)

This document is a **discovery-to-onboarding stress test** for the BMAD v6 Training Programme.

Its purpose is to ensure that:
- Discovery channels act as *filters*, not amplifiers
- Onboarding does not compensate for misaligned discovery
- The programme is encountered at moments of **consequence**, not curiosity

This refinement tightens causal claims, corrects overconfidence in certain channels, and clarifies where discovery assumptions can quietly break calibration.

---

## What Was Slightly Overstated

### 1. “Post-exposure reflection” as the dominant discovery moment

**Original risk**: Implying most high-quality entrants arrive immediately after a failure or challenge.

**Refinement**:
- Some of the best entrants arrive in a *pre-emptive* state:
  - They sense fragility
  - They anticipate scrutiny
  - They have seen others fail

This is not post-failure, but **pre-defensive readiness**.

**Design implication**: Discovery language should speak to *imminent exposure*, not only past mistakes.

---

### 2. Word of mouth as uniformly high-quality

**Original risk**: Treating practitioner referrals as inherently well-aligned.

**Refinement**:
- Word of mouth varies dramatically depending on *what is praised*:
  - “This gave me language to defend decisions” → good
  - “This made me faster” → dangerous

**Design implication**: The programme must actively shape how it is described by practitioners.

---

### 3. Tool adjacency framed as mostly a misuse risk

**Original risk**: Overweighting framework fetishisation as the dominant failure mode.

**Refinement**:
- Tool-adjacent discoverers are often **deeply serious**
- Their risk is not fetishisation, but *over-compliance*

They are prone to:
- Over-following steps
- Treating BMAD as exhaustive

**Design implication**: Onboarding must emphasise *selective omission*, not just stopping.

---

## What Was Missing

### 1. Discovery is also a trust gradient

**Missing element**: Different channels confer different kinds of trust.

Refinement:
- Word of mouth → interpersonal trust
- YouTube / talks → epistemic trust (ideas)
- Docs / repos → procedural trust

**Design implication**: Onboarding must resolve *the wrong kind of trust* before calibration can occur.

---

### 2. The cost of premature seriousness

**Missing element**: Not all seriousness is helpful.

Some entrants:
- Over-identify with the method immediately
- Seek to be “correct” rather than calibrated

**Design implication**: Early onboarding must *slow down over-commitment* as much as under-commitment.

---

### 3. Discovery paths converge faster than assumed

**Missing element**: Overstating the long-term importance of discovery origin.

**Refinement**:
- Discovery path matters most in the **first 30–60 minutes**
- After first calibration, origin should be irrelevant

**Design implication**: Do not create long-lived onboarding branches.

---

## Refined Discovery Paths

### 1. Practitioner-to-Practitioner Referral (Still Highest Quality)

**Refined characteristics**:
- Trust is borrowed, not earned
- Expectations are shaped by the referrer’s framing

**Onboarding correction**:
- Re-anchor around *judgement*, not speed
- Make calibration explicit early

---

### 2. Long-Form Content (YouTube, Talks, Essays)

**Refined characteristics**:
- High idea affinity
- Moderate practical readiness

**Onboarding correction**:
- Collapse theory into one concrete decision quickly
- Interrupt analysis loops early

---

### 3. Tool / Framework Adjacency

**Refined characteristics**:
- High seriousness
- High compliance bias

**Onboarding correction**:
- Explicitly instruct learners to *not* follow everything
- Provide sanctioned shortcuts and omissions

---

## Channels to Treat with Caution (Reaffirmed)

- Short-form social media
- Open community funnels
- Influencer-driven promotion

These create attention without calibration.

---

## Refined Discovery Strategy (Launch)

### Primary
1. Quiet practitioner referral
2. Long-form, critical content

### Secondary
- Docs and repo adjacency with **hard repulsion language**

Avoid:
- Generic AI productivity framing
- “Join the community” calls to action

---

## Refined Discovery → Onboarding Contract

Discovery should do **one thing well**:

> Put the learner in the correct psychological posture for calibration.

Onboarding should do **one thing only**:

> Convert posture into action on a real decision.

Anything else is noise.

---

## Landing Page (Refined Implication)

The landing page must:
- Name *imminent* scrutiny
- Signal seriousness without intimidation
- Repel tourists without shaming

Example framing:

> “If your AI-assisted work needs to stand up to questioning — this is for you.”

---

## Final Position (Refined)

Discovery is not about reach.
It is about **arriving at the right moment, in the right mental state**.

BMAD should be:
- Hard to stumble into
- Easy to recognise when needed

If onboarding has to persuade, discovery already failed.

*This refined document should guide channel prioritisation, landing-page tone, onboarding structure, and early funnel discipline for the BMAD v6 Training Programme.*
