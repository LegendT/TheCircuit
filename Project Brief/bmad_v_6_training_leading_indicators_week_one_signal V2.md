# BMAD v6 Training – Leading Indicators (Week-One Signal, Refined)

This document defines the **earliest credible signal** that the BMAD v6 Training Programme has both *pedagogical traction* and *commercial potential*.

It is explicitly designed to answer:

> **“Do people change how they decide before we persuade, reward, or scale?”**

This refinement sharpens what truly predicts success, removes signals that are easy to misread, and clarifies what *absence* of signals actually means.

---

## What Was Slightly Overstated

### 1. Unprompted second use as a near-universal early signal

**Original risk**: Treating unprompted second use as something you should reliably see in week one.

**Refinement**:
- Some high-value users have *only one live decision* in the first week
- Others mentally re-frame work before acting again

**Corrected position**:
- Unprompted second use is the **strongest** signal when it appears
- Its absence is *not* failure unless paired with other negative indicators

**Design implication**: Look for *intent to reuse*, not only executed reuse.

---

### 2. Language shift interpreted too literally

**Original risk**: Over-indexing on specific phrases ("sufficient", "rejected X").

**Refinement**:
- Some learners internalise calibration before adopting the vocabulary
- Others mirror language without internal shift

**Corrected position**:
- The signal is *structural clarity*, not word choice
- Look for clearer decision boundaries, not keyword usage

---

### 3. Early stopping framed as universally positive

**Original risk**: Assuming stopping early always indicates calibration.

**Refinement**:
- Early stopping can also signal:
  - Avoidance
  - Uncertainty
  - Loss of confidence

**Corrected position**:
- Stopping is a positive signal **only when paired with explicit justification**

---

## What Was Missing

### 1. The distinction between behaviour change and posture change

**Missing element**: Some learners change *how they think* before how they act.

**Refinement**:
Early success can appear as:
- Narrower scope framing
- Fewer alternatives entertained
- Clearer sense of “what would change my mind”

Even if no second artefact exists yet.

---

### 2. The role of friction (good vs bad)

**Missing element**: Not all friction is failure.

**Refinement**:
- Productive friction feels like:
  - “This is harder, but clearer”
- Harmful friction feels like:
  - “I don’t know what you want from me”

**Design implication**: Early learner feedback must be classified, not averaged.

---

### 3. The danger of false positives

**Missing element**: Some early enthusiasm predicts later failure.

High-risk false positives include:
- Requests for more templates
- Desire to formalise everything
- Praise focused on structure, not decisions

These often precede over-formalisation and drop-off.

---

## Refined Leading Indicator Model

Instead of a single signal, use **signal clusters** across three dimensions:

1. **Intent** (do they want to reuse?)
2. **Ownership** (do they claim decisions?)
3. **Boundary clarity** (do they know when to stop?)

---

## 1. Intent Signals (Earliest)

### Positive
- “I’m going to use this on X next.”
- “This would have helped last week.”
- Saving or re-opening the framework unprompted

### Negative
- “This is interesting, but…”
- Requests for more explanation without application

Intent often precedes action by days or weeks.

---

## 2. Ownership Signals (Most Diagnostic)

### Positive
- First-person decision language
- Explicit rejection of alternatives
- Acceptance of consequence

### Negative
- Appeals to authority (AI, framework, best practice)
- Over-justification

Ownership is the **clearest early predictor** of reuse.

---

## 3. Boundary Signals (Hardest to Fake)

### Positive
- Named stopping points
- Clear sufficiency criteria
- Statements like:
  > “Nothing else would change this decision.”

### Negative
- Endless extension
- Reluctance to commit

Boundary clarity indicates calibration taking hold.

## Refined Week-One Diagnostic Checklist

At the end of week one, check:

1. Did **any learner** show *intent* to reuse BMAD on another decision?
2. Did **any learner** explicitly own a decision without deferring to authority?
3. Did **any learner** articulate a justified stopping point?

Interpretation:
- **0/3** → pause and investigate onboarding
- **1/3** → continue cautiously
- **2/3 or more** → strong signal the programme has legs

---

## Signals to Actively Ignore (Reinforced)

Do **not** treat these as success:

- High early enthusiasm
- Praise for content clarity
- Requests for more material
- High completion velocity

They correlate poorly with calibration.

---

## The True Meta-Signal (Refined)

The most reliable early sentence is not excitement, but restraint:

> “I don’t need to do more work to feel confident about this decision.”

That sentence only appears when judgement is re-emerging.

---

## Final Leading-Indicator Test

Ask yourself:

> *“Would I trust this person to make the same kind of decision again, without me?”*

If the answer is yes — even for one learner — the programme is on the right track.

If the answer is no for everyone, do not scale.

*This refined document should be used as an early-warning system and confidence gate before investing in growth, marketing, or organisational rollout for the BMAD v6 Training Programme.*
