# Where Competing Offerings Fall Short

This document outlines the **structural and systemic limitations** of existing training, certification, and education offerings relative to the goals of the **BMAD v6 Training Programme**.

These are not marketing critiques. They are **design-level gaps** that materially affect execution quality, longevity, credibility, and professional value.

## Pragmatic Institute

### What it does well
- Strong, opinionated framework
- High enterprise credibility
- Clear certification ladder

### Where it falls short
- **Not AI-native**
  - AI is bolted on rather than foundational
  - No conception of AI as an execution partner
- **Static content model**
  - Courses age quickly
  - Updates require new courses, not versioned evolution
- **Weak decision tooling**
  - Emphasises best practices over decision-making under uncertainty
- **No operational execution system**
  - Learners leave with ideas, not a repeatable delivery engine

**BMAD advantage**: BMAD teaches a living, AI-mediated execution system rather than a snapshot of best practice.

## Reforge

### What it does well
- Excellent pedagogy and learning UX
- Strong systems-thinking orientation
- High-calibre instructors

### Where it falls short
- **No canonical method**
  - Frameworks are plural and optional
  - Synthesis burden is pushed onto the learner
- **No verification or enforcement**
  - Completion does not imply competence
- **Poor organisational transferability**
  - Hard to standardise learning across teams or agencies
- **AI integration is conceptual**
  - Insightful, but not embedded into day-to-day execution workflows

**BMAD advantage**: Reforge sharpens thinking; BMAD standardises action.

## AIPMM

### What it does well
- Recognised certification brand
- Clear syllabus and exam structure
- Familiar to HR and procurement teams

### Where it falls short
- **Outdated mental model**
  - Linear lifecycle thinking struggles with modern uncertainty
- **Low practical signal**
  - Certification often signals attendance rather than applied competence
- **No AI worldview**
  - Fundamentally pre-AI in its assumptions
- **No meaningful update cadence**
  - Credentials do not evolve with practice

**BMAD advantage**: BMAD certification can signal current, verified execution competence.

## Coursera / Udemy (category-level issues)

### What they do well
- Massive scale
- Low cost and accessibility

### Where they fall short
- **No coherence**
  - No unifying method or learning journey
- **No professional trust signal**
  - Certificates carry little or no career weight
- **Severe content rot**
  - Weak incentives to maintain or update material
- **No execution linkage**
  - Learning is disconnected from real-world delivery
- **No seriousness about security, IP, or integrity**

**BMAD advantage**: BMAD provides professional execution infrastructure, not content consumption.

## Cross-cutting Gaps Across the Market

### 1. No guidance on “how much process is enough”
Most programmes assume either full adoption or ad-hoc cherry-picking. BMAD explicitly teaches how to decide which parts of the method to apply, when, and why.

### 2. No version awareness
Competitors treat courses as finished artefacts. BMAD treats knowledge as versioned, upgradeable, and auditable.

### 3. No execution verification
Most certifications verify attendance. BMAD is designed to verify repeatable execution under constraint.

### 4. AI treated as a topic, not a collaborator
Others teach about AI. BMAD teaches how to work with AI inside a structured delivery system.

## Strategic Implications

These gaps justify:
- Premium pricing
- Strict certification standards
- Limited certification volume
- Positioning BMAD as execution infrastructure rather than education
- Making updates and re-certification part of the value proposition
