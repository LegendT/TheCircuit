# BMAD v6 Training – Buyer vs User: Design Implications (Refined)

This document is a **buyer–user separation stress test** for the BMAD v6 Training Programme.

Its purpose is to ensure that:
- The learning experience remains uncompromised for the person doing the work
- Commercial adoption is not blocked by lack of buyer legibility
- The programme does not drift into corporate theatre or compliance training

This refinement tightens boundaries, removes a few implicit assumptions, and makes the buyer–user split more operational.

---

## What Was Slightly Overstated

### 1. “Designed for the user, legible to the buyer” needed sharper limits

**Original risk**: The phrase can be interpreted too generously, leading teams to quietly optimise learning for buyer comfort.

**Refinement**:
- Buyer legibility must never influence:
  - Exercises
  - Success criteria
  - Gating logic
- Buyer needs are met **only through derivative artefacts**, never through altered pedagogy.

**Design implication**: If an element exists *only* to reassure the buyer, it does not belong inside the programme.

---

### 2. Buyers were treated as more homogeneous than they are

**Original risk**: Treating “the buyer” as a single mindset.

**Refinement**:
There are at least three materially different buyer types:

1. **Founder / owner buyers** — care about risk, reputation, revenue
2. **Operational leaders** — care about consistency and escalation reduction
3. **Procurement / L&D** — care about defensibility, not effectiveness

Only the first two should meaningfully shape product direction.

**Design implication**: Do not optimise early design for procurement logic.

---

### 3. The cost of buyer influence was underplayed

**Original risk**: Understating how quickly buyer-driven requirements can corrode judgement training.

**Refinement**:
- Every buyer-facing metric introduces behavioural distortion
- Visibility can quickly become performative

**Design implication**: Fewer buyer metrics, derived late, are safer than rich real-time dashboards.

---

## What Was Missing

### 1. Explicit failure modes when buyer and user incentives diverge

**Missing element**: Clear articulation of what happens when:
- Buyers want speed
- Users need restraint

**Refinement**:
BMAD must explicitly side with the **user’s judgement**, even if this frustrates buyer expectations.

**Design implication**: The programme must tolerate buyer discomfort to preserve integrity.

---

### 2. Budget authority vs risk ownership

**Missing element**: Budget control and risk ownership are often split.

Examples:
- Founder pays, delivery lead is exposed
- Director buys, senior IC is judged

**Refinement**:
Fast adoption occurs when the *exposed party* sees value — not when the payer is convinced.

**Design implication**: Marketing should target the exposed role, even when selling requires upward justification.

---

### 3. Buyer pressure increases over time

**Missing element**: Buyer influence intensifies as spend increases.

**Refinement**:
- Individual purchases tolerate ambiguity
- Team and org purchases invite scrutiny

**Design implication**:
- Early tiers should minimise buyer surface area
- Buyer translation layers should expand only as price and scope increase

---

## Refined Buyer–User Model

### The User (Non-Negotiable Priority)

The user is the person who:
- Makes decisions under scrutiny
- Is exposed when work fails
- Bears reputational or professional cost

Their success metric remains:

> *“I can make and defend better decisions under pressure.”*

No buyer requirement should override this.

---

### The Buyer (Contextual, Not Central)

The buyer is the person or entity who:
- Controls spend
- Wants reduced risk and greater consistency

Their legitimate need is:

> *“I can justify this expense and see reduced downside.”*

This need must be met **without altering user behaviour**.

---

## Refined Design Split

### Inside the Programme (Strictly User-Centric)

- No buyer dashboards
- No completion theatre
- No cosmetic certifications
- No artificial metrics

Only:
- Decisions
- Trade-offs
- Justifications

---

### Outside the Programme (Buyer Translation Layer)

- Minimal
- Derived from real work
- Lagging, not real-time

Examples:
- Decision summaries
- Before/after scope comparisons
- Evidence of avoided rework

---

## Refined Pricing and Packaging Implications

- MVP tier: user is buyer → zero buyer surface
- Agency tier: buyer ≠ user → light translation layer
- Org tier: expanded translation, still no behavioural distortion

**Rule**: Translation scales with price, not with pedagogy.

---

## Final Integrity Test (Refined)

Ask three questions:

**User**:
> “Did this make my judgement sharper?”

**Exposed role**:
> “Does this protect me under scrutiny?”

**Buyer**:
> “Can I justify paying for this without needing to interfere?”

If any answer requires changing the learning experience, the design is wrong.

*This refined document should be used as a guardrail against buyer-driven dilution while still enabling sustainable commercial adoption of the BMAD v6 Training Programme.*
