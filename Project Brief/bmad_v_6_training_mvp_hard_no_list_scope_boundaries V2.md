# BMAD v6 Training – MVP Hard No List (Refined Scope Boundaries)

This document defines the **non-negotiable exclusions** for the BMAD v6 Training MVP.

Its purpose is not to be restrictive.
It is to **protect proof** — proof that BMAD restores judgement *before* it reassures buyers, scales teams, or accumulates features.

This refinement sharpens the reasoning, removes any absolutism that could backfire later, and clarifies *why each “no” is structurally necessary at MVP stage*.

---

## What Was Slightly Overstated

### 1. “These are not later maybe” risked sounding dogmatic

**Original risk**: Framing refusals as ideological rather than phase-specific.

**Refinement**:
- Every item on this list is a **temporal no**, not a permanent one
- The refusal is about *order*, not *direction*

**Design implication**:
The MVP question is not “is this valuable?” but:
> *“Would this prevent us from knowing whether the core works?”*

---

### 2. Individual-only pricing could be misread as market avoidance

**Original risk**: Appearing uninterested in agencies or teams.

**Refinement**:
- Individual-only pricing is a **signal filter**, not a revenue ceiling
- It ensures first proof comes from exposed decision-makers, not procurement flows

**Design implication**:
This is about *who experiences the intervention*, not who ultimately pays.

---

### 3. Non-technical exclusion risked sounding elitist

**Original risk**: “Non-technical” could be misinterpreted as capability-based gatekeeping.

**Refinement**:
- The exclusion is about **decision exposure**, not technical skill
- The MVP targets roles where decisions are regularly questioned and defended

**Design implication**:
Language should reference *exposure and consequence*, not discipline.

---

## What Was Missing

### 1. The proof-first doctrine

**Missing element**: A single unifying rationale for all refusals.

**Refinement**:
Every MVP exclusion exists to protect one thing:

> **The ability to observe unprompted, second-use of BMAD on real decisions.**

Anything that introduces reassurance, signalling, or coordination before that signal appears is excluded.

---

### 2. The “reassurance trap”

**Missing element**: Why so many requested features feel helpful but are dangerous.

**Refinement**:
Most refused features share a hidden function:
- They make the programme feel safer
- They reduce personal risk
- They soften accountability

BMAD’s value emerges only when those comforts are absent.

---

### 3. Clear re-entry conditions

**Missing element**: Explicit criteria for when a refused feature may return.

**Refinement**:
Each exclusion should have a **proof-based re-entry gate**, not a roadmap promise.

---

## Refined MVP “Hard No” Categories

Instead of a flat list, refusals now fall into four structural categories.

---

## Category A: Authority Substitutes (Hard No)

These replace internal judgement with external approval.

### ❌ Certification (at MVP)

- Introduces pass/fail optimisation
- Shifts focus from decision ownership to credential acquisition

**Re-entry condition**:
- Reuse under pressure is already happening
- Certification can verify sufficiency *without scoring*

---

### ❌ Mentors, Coaches, or Live Review

- Create dependency
- Replace judgement with reassurance

**Re-entry condition**:
- Learners demonstrate stable ownership without support

---

## Category B: Coordination Prematurely Introduced (Hard No)

These require alignment before individual proof exists.

### ❌ Team Pricing / Seat Management

- Implies rollout before value is proven
- Pulls procurement logic into MVP

**Re-entry condition**:
- Quiet organisational pull (teams asking, not being sold)

---

### ❌ Collaboration or Co-Authoring

- Dilutes ownership
- Obscures accountability

**Re-entry condition**:
- Read-only artefact sharing is already trusted and used

---

## Category C: Reassurance & Optics Features (Hard No)

These make the programme feel complete without being effective.

### ❌ Dashboards, Progress Indicators, KPIs

- Encourage performance over judgement
- Undermine finality

**Re-entry condition**:
- None at learner level
- Only allowed as internal diagnostics

---

### ❌ Community, Forums, Peer Feedback

- Introduce comparison and signalling
- Shift authority outward

**Re-entry condition**:
- Only after judgement independence is demonstrably stable

---

## Category D: Scope Dilution (Hard No)

These broaden surface area before depth is proven.

### ❌ Multiple Audience Tracks

- Weakens constraint language
- Obscures core problem

**Re-entry condition**:
- Core intervention works reliably for one exposure profile

---

### ❌ Extended Theory or Concept Libraries

- Delay action
- Encourage consumption over decision-making

**Re-entry condition**:
- Learners repeatedly request explanation *after* using the system successfully

---

## What *Is* Allowed (Reaffirmed)

- One decision per session
- One owner per decision
- One defensible artefact
- One decisive stop

This constraint set is not minimalism.
It is proof discipline.

---

## The Refined Scope Integrity Test

Before adding *anything*, ask:

> *“Would this make it harder to tell whether BMAD restored judgement — or just easier for someone to feel comfortable?”*

If it increases comfort before proof, it is out of scope.

---

## Final Position (Refined)

The MVP must feel:
- Sparse
- Serious
- Slightly exposed

If the product feels safe, familiar, or impressive too early, it has failed.

Judgement does not emerge from reassurance.
It emerges from **constraint plus consequence**.

*This refined document should act as a standing scope governor for MVP development, pricing discussions, and stakeholder pressure related to the BMAD v6 Training Programme.*
