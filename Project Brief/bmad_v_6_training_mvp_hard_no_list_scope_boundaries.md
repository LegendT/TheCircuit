# BMAD v6 Training – MVP Hard No List (Scope Boundaries)

This document defines the **explicit scope refusals** for the BMAD v6 Training MVP.

Its purpose is not negativity.
It is to prevent **credibility dilution, premature optimisation, and false completeness**.

Every item on this list is something that *will* be requested.
Saying “no” is a product decision, not a lack of ambition.

---

## Core Principle

> **If a feature reduces judgement ownership, introduces external approval, or delays irreversible action, it does not belong in the MVP.**

The MVP exists to prove one thing only:

> *A constrained decision environment can restore judgement under scrutiny in a single sitting.*

Anything that does not directly serve that is out of scope.

---

## The Hard Line

For MVP, the line is drawn **after one completed, defensible decision**.

If a feature is not required to:
- force a real decision
- constrain overwork
- produce a defensible artefact
- and end decisively

…it is explicitly excluded.

---

## Explicit MVP “No” List

These are not “later maybe.”
They are **deliberate exclusions** for MVP.

---

## ❌ Certification

**Why it will be requested**:
- Buyer reassurance
- Signalling legitimacy
- Familiar training optics

**Why it is out of scope**:
- Certification introduces external authority
- Encourages optimisation for passing
- Shifts focus from judgement to compliance

**MVP position**:
- No certificates
- No badges
- No completion proof

Legitimacy must come from *artefacts in the wild*, not credentials.

---

## ❌ Team Pricing / Seat Management

**Why it will be requested**:
- Agencies want bulk discounts
- Buyers want procurement-friendly models

**Why it is out of scope**:
- Team pricing implies coordination and rollout
- Introduces buyer pressure before value is proven

**MVP position**:
- Individual purchase only
- No seat bundles
- No admin dashboards

Organisational demand must be pulled, not sold.

---

## ❌ Non-Technical / General-Audience Tracks

**Why it will be requested**:
- Larger market
- Accessibility optics
- Fear of exclusion

**Why it is out of scope**:
- The calibration deficit is most acute in exposed technical / delivery roles
- Broadening audience weakens constraint language

**MVP position**:
- One audience
- One decision posture
- No parallel tracks

Depth before breadth.

---

## ❌ Peer Interaction or Community

**Why it will be requested**:
- Engagement expectations
- “Learning community” norms

**Why it is out of scope**:
- Introduces social comparison
- Encourages approval-seeking
- Shifts authority away from the learner

**MVP position**:
- No discussion areas
- No peer feedback
- No shared spaces

Judgement must stand alone first.

---

## ❌ Mentors, Coaches, or Live Support

**Why it will be requested**:
- Reassurance
- Acceleration narratives

**Why it is out of scope**:
- Creates dependency
- Replaces internal judgement with external confirmation

**MVP position**:
- Fully self-directed
- No live calls
- No DM support

If it can’t work without hand-holding, it doesn’t work.

---

## ❌ Extended Theory or Concept Modules

**Why it will be requested**:
- Intellectual curiosity
- Desire for justification

**Why it is out of scope**:
- Theory delays action
- Encourages consumption over decision-making

**MVP position**:
- Zero long-form theory
- No explainer videos
- No background reading

Understanding emerges *after* action.

---

## ❌ Dashboards, Progress Tracking, or KPIs

**Why it will be requested**:
- Buyer comfort
- Familiar SaaS patterns

**Why it is out of scope**:
- Creates performative behaviour
- Undermines finality
- Reintroduces external evaluation

**MVP position**:
- No progress bars
- No completion percentages
- No analytics surfaced to learners

Silence is intentional.

---

## ❌ Multiple Decisions per Session

**Why it will be requested**:
- Perceived efficiency
- Power-user expectations

**Why it is out of scope**:
- Encourages batching
- Reduces seriousness of each decision

**MVP position**:
- One decision per session
- Deliberate friction to restart

Quality over throughput.

---

## What Is *Allowed* to Re-Enter Later (Explicitly Deferred)

These are not rejected forever, only **post-MVP**:

- Certification (as verification, not grading)
- Team pricing (after organisational pull)
- Read-only sharing (already Tier-3 minimum)
- Limited human verification

But only after:
- Unprompted second use is proven
- Quiet organisational pull exists
- Method integrity survives load

---

## The Scope Integrity Test

Before adding *anything*, ask:

> *“Does this help a learner make, stop, and defend a decision — or does it make the programme feel safer?”*

If it’s about safety, reassurance, or optics, it is out of scope for MVP.

---

## Final Position

The MVP is intentionally *uncomfortable*.

That discomfort is the signal that judgement is being exercised, not outsourced.

A successful MVP will feel:
- Sparse
- Serious
- Slightly confronting

That is not a bug.

It is the product.

*This document should be treated as a non-negotiable scope boundary for the BMAD v6 Training MVP. Any exception must explicitly argue how it strengthens constraint, ownership, or irreversibility — not appeal, scale, or familiarity.*
