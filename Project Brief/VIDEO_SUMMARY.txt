Detailed Content Log: The BMAD Builder V6 Alpha
Introduction & Milestones
[00:00:00] Celebration: The speaker opens by celebrating six months since the release of the BMAD method. He highlights reaching 20,000 subscribers and nearly 18,000 GitHub stars.

[00:00:25] V4 Success: Mentions the V4 Masterclass released two months ago, which has over 100,000 views.

[00:01:12] V6 Alpha Announcement: Officially announces the release of the V6 Alpha version. The full beta is expected in 1-2 weeks.

[00:01:39] Call for Testers: Invites the community to test the Alpha branch, find bugs, and influence the future of the project.

The 5 Major Features of V6
1. Scale Adaptive Framework

[00:03:54] The Problem: Previous versions (V4) were "one size fits all" and difficult to apply to "brownfield" (existing) projects.

[00:04:02] The Solution: V6 introduces a Scale Adaptive framework. The agent assesses the user's ambition at the start—whether it's a massive enterprise microservice architecture or a simple patch for an existing codebase.

[00:04:29] Workflow Adaptation: Based on this assessment, the system dynamically adjusts the workflow (e.g., choosing between a complex Product Requirement Document or a simple tech spec).

2. Segregation of the Core

[00:04:58] Restructuring: The "BMAD Core" has been separated from the "BMAD Method." The Core is now a generic engine, and the BMAD Method is just a module running on top of it.

[00:05:23] Modules (formerly Expansion Packs): This separation facilitates "Modules" for non-coding tasks like creative writing, data science, therapy, and game development.

[00:06:42] Community Contribution: This makes it easier for the community to build and share their own modules for various industries.

3. Localization & Agent Customization

[00:07:30] Global Reach: Acknowledging the global user base, V6 adds full localization support.

[00:07:47] Language Override: Users can install the framework in their preferred language (e.g., French, German, Spanish, Japanese), and agents will communicate exclusively in that language.

[00:08:28] Personality Customization: Users can customize agent personas (e.g., a "friendly analyst" or a "cursing pirate"). These customizations are preserved even after software updates.

4. Project Types & Reference Architectures

[00:09:21] Context Awareness: The framework now understands different Project Types (e.g., web apps, console apps, video games, embedded drivers).

[00:10:08] Tailored Workflows: If a user selects "Game Development," the system helps create a Game Design Document (GDD) instead of a standard PRD. It supports over 50 specific game types.

[00:11:37] Document Handling: V6 removes the need to "shard" documents manually; the system now handles documents as they are imported.

[00:12:08] Feature 4.5: Reference Architectures: A new feature allowing the community to submit and use pre-configured architecture templates (Reference Architectures) to speed up the setup of new "greenfield" projects.

5. The "BOMB" (BMAD Builder)

[00:13:27] The "Bomb": Introduction of the BMAD Method Builder Module.

[00:13:43] Purpose: A module specifically designed to help users build their own agents, workflows, and modules.

[00:15:00] Tiny Agents: Introduces support for "Tiny BMAD Agents"—standalone, single-file agents that can be compiled to perform specific, one-off tasks (e.g., a personal coach or helper).

Installation & Demo
[00:16:36] GitHub Setup: The speaker navigates to the GitHub repository and shows how to switch to the V6-alpha branch.

[00:17:36] Terminal Setup:

Opens a terminal.

Creates a directory named demo.

Clones the repository.

[00:18:26] Installation:

Runs npm install to get dependencies.

Runs the specific installer command: npm run install:bmad.

[00:19:33] Configuration Wizard: The installer prompts for:

Installation Path: He creates a new folder project one.

User Name: Sets it to "BMAD".

Language: Keeps "English" (default).

Modules: Selects all three: Core, Method, and Builder.

Custom Agents: Accepts defaults.

Project Name: Sets as "my project".

IDE: Selects Cloud Code (mentioning VS Code and Cursor are also options).

[00:22:16] Sub-Agents: Because Cloud Code was selected, the installer asks to install sub-agents. He confirms with "Yes".

[00:23:07] Verification:

He opens VS Code in the new directory.

Runs the Product Manager agent.

The agent successfully loads and greets him by the custom name "BMAD," confirming the installation is correct.

Conclusion
[00:24:04] Future Content: Promises more videos in the coming weeks covering sub-agents and other deep dives as the official V6 release approaches.
