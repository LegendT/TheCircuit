# BMAD v6 Training – Who Hurts Enough to Pay (Refined)

This document is a **commercial stress-test** of the BMAD v6 Training Programme.

Its purpose is to distinguish:
- Who experiences the calibration deficit
- Who experiences it *acutely enough to pay*
- Who converts reliably *without coercion or hype*

This refinement tightens buyer signals, removes overreach, and clarifies *why* some segments pay faster than others.

---

## The Calibration Deficit (Sharpened)

People do not pay because AI is confusing.
They pay when **uncertainty becomes reputational, financial, or identity-threatening**.

The common trigger state is:

> “I can no longer tell whether my speed is earned or reckless — and someone else is about to judge that for me.”

BMAD is not purchased as learning.
It is purchased as **defensibility under scrutiny**.

---

## What Was Slightly Overstated

Before refining who pays, it is important to remove two subtle overstatements.

### 1. Pain alone is not enough

Many people feel the calibration deficit.
Only some feel **consequence**.

Refinement:
- Pain converts only when paired with:
  - External judgement (client, peer, manager)
  - Imminent review or exposure

---

### 2. “Everyone using AI at work” is too broad

AI use is now widespread.
Calibration pain is not.

Refinement:
- Buyers are those whose work:
  - Must be justified
  - Can be questioned
  - Has downstream cost

---

# Tier 1 — Acute, Consequential Pain (Fastest Conversion)

These buyers have already crossed from discomfort into **exposure**.

---

## 1. The Agency Lead Who Lost Narrative Control

### Who they are
- Agency founders
- Delivery leads
- Heads of product / engineering in services firms

### Trigger event
- AI-accelerated delivery
- A client review, change request, or audit
- Inability to clearly defend decisions

### Refined pain
Not speed failure — **credibility failure**.

> “I can’t explain why this is right — only that it’s fast.”

### Why they pay quickly
- Revenue and retention are at risk
- They need a *visible* delivery discipline

### Why BMAD fits
- Converts speed into defensible decisions
- Produces artefacts safe for external scrutiny

**This remains the strongest early buyer**, but only post-trigger.

---

## 2. The Senior IC Under Increased Visibility

### Who they are
- Senior / staff / principal engineers
- Senior PMs and designers

### Trigger event
- AI increases output and visibility
- Reasoning is questioned more often
- Effort is no longer a shield

### Refined pain
Loss of plausible deniability.

> “I’m now judged on judgement, not effort.”

### Why they pay
- Identity-level threat
- Desire to operate in a visibly mature way

### Why BMAD fits
- Makes judgement legible
- Provides language for restraint

**Note**: This group converts best when self-directed, not mandated.

---

# Tier 2 — Oscillating Pain, Converts After Fatigue or Failure

These buyers struggle longer before acting.

---

## 3. The Indie Builder with Structure Whiplash

### Who they are
- Indie developers
- Solo founders
- Advanced builders

### Trigger event
- Framework adoption → overwhelm
- Retreat into unstructured prompting
- Repeated restarts

### Refined pain
Oscillation, not ignorance.

> “I don’t know which parts of structure actually matter.”

### Why they pay
- Exhaustion from context switching
- Desire for sufficiency, not completeness

### Why BMAD training (not just BMAD)
- The framework surfaces the deficit
- Training resolves calibration

**Conversion improves after visible stall or burnout**, not curiosity.

---

# Tier 3 — Latent Pain, Converts via Authority or Standardisation

These buyers rarely self-identify first.

---

## 4. The Accountability Holder in a Noisy System

### Who they are
- Engineering managers
- Product leads
- Architects

### Trigger event
- Inconsistent AI usage across teams
- Quality disputes
- Blame landing upward

### Refined pain

> “If this goes wrong, I own it — but I don’t control the process.”

### Why they pay
- Risk containment
- Desire for neutral standards

### Why BMAD fits
- Shifts debate from personality to process
- Makes decisions reviewable

Often funded via teams or organisations, not individuals.

---

# Who Still Does *Not* Convert Reliably

Refinement: these groups are not just low-conversion — they actively resist BMAD.

---

## ❌ The AI Tourist
- Exploration without stakes
- No external accountability

## ❌ The Throughput-Only Manager
- Values speed over justification
- Sees explanation as drag

## ❌ The Framework Collector
- Uses structure to avoid judgement
- Optimises for coverage, not clarity

BMAD removes their protective layers.

---

# The True Common Denominator (Restated)

Across all paying segments:

- Work is visible
- Judgement is reviewable
- Failure has cost

BMAD is purchased when people realise:

> “Someone else will judge my decisions. I need to be able to explain them.”

That is the willingness-to-pay threshold.

---

## Practical Refinements to Apply

- Write onboarding copy around **trigger moments**, not roles
- Price early tiers for *individual purchase under stress*
- Treat agency and senior ICs as initial wedge markets
- Design repulsion copy that names who this is *not* for

*This refined document should guide persona prioritisation, messaging, pricing, and early go-to-market sequencing for the BMAD v6 Training Programme.*
