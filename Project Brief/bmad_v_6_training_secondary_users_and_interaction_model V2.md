# BMAD v6 Training – Secondary Users and Interaction Model (Refined)

This document is a **secondary-role stress test** for the BMAD v6 Training Programme.

Its purpose is to prevent a common failure mode of serious methods: drifting from **judgement training** into **social, authority, or status systems** that feel helpful but quietly undermine calibration.

This refinement tightens the argument, clarifies sequencing, and makes the interaction model more operational.

---

## What Was Slightly Overstated

### 1. “Self-service” risked sounding like ideological purity

**Original risk**: Framing self-service as inherently superior, rather than situationally safer.

**Refinement**:
- Self-service is not a value judgement
- It is the *lowest-distortion default* for early calibration

Human roles are not rejected because they are bad, but because:
- They introduce authority gradients
- They change learner incentives
- They shift attention from decisions to approval

**Design implication**: Self-service is a *protective constraint*, not a philosophy.

---

### 2. Moderators were treated as mostly neutral

**Original risk**: Underestimating how quickly moderators become informal authorities.

**Refinement**:
- Any visible human presence becomes interpretive by default
- Learners will optimise for moderator approval even when told not to

**Design implication**:
- Moderation must be:
  - Minimal
  - Largely invisible
  - Focused strictly on hygiene, not interpretation

If moderators are thanked or visible, they are already too influential.

---

### 3. Mentorship was rejected without acknowledging its pull

**Original risk**: Treating mentorship as an obvious non-starter, when it is emotionally attractive.

**Refinement**:
- Mentorship feels valuable because it reduces anxiety
- That reduction often comes at the cost of judgement development

**Design implication**:
- The programme must explicitly name *why* mentorship is absent
- Otherwise learners assume something is missing

---

## What Was Missing

### 1. The learner’s desire for reassurance

**Missing element**: Learners will actively seek validation when calibration is uncomfortable.

They may:
- Ask “am I doing this right?”
- Seek comparison with peers
- Look for authority confirmation

**Refinement**:
The interaction model must *withstand reassurance-seeking*, not pretend it won’t happen.

**Design implication**:
- Exercises should provide **structural reassurance** (clear constraints, hard stops)
- Not emotional reassurance from humans

---

### 2. The difference between interpretation and enforcement

**Missing element**: Not all human roles distort calibration equally.

**Refinement**:
- Interpretation ("what BMAD means") is dangerous
- Enforcement ("this artefact meets the criteria") is safer

**Design implication**:
- If humans are involved, they should verify constraints, not explain reasoning

---

### 3. The moment when secondary users become necessary

**Missing element**: A clear threshold for introducing human roles.

**Refinement**:
Secondary users become justified only when:
- External signalling matters (certification)
- Stakes exceed self-correction (org-wide rollout)
- Misinterpretation risk exceeds distortion risk

Before that point, they are premature.

---

## Refined Secondary Role Evaluation

### Community Moderators

**Allowed when**:
- Noise threatens comprehension
- Misuse spreads faster than self-correction

**Hard limits**:
- No interpretation
- No advice
- No visibility as experts

Their function is janitorial, not pedagogical.

---

### Mentors / Coaches

**Allowed only when**:
- Explicitly positioned as optional
- Paid and bounded
- Time-limited

**Never allowed to**:
- Validate decisions
- Override learner judgement

They may ask questions, not give answers.

---

### Content Contributors

**Allowed only for**:
- Examples
- Case illustrations

**Never for**:
- Method definition
- Norm setting

Curation must remain centralised.

---

### Assessment Reviewers

**Appropriate when**:
- Certification has real signalling value
- External trust matters

**Constraints**:
- Review criteria must be explicit
- No subjective scoring
- No comparative ranking

Reviewers verify sufficiency, not excellence.

---

### Peer Interaction

**Allowed only if**:
- Artefact-focused
- Asynchronous
- Non-evaluative

**Disallowed**:
- Likes
- Rankings
- Leaderboards
- “Best practice” threads

Peers normalise restraint, not compete.

---

## Refined Launch Interaction Model

### Launch Phase

- Fully self-paced learning
- No visible authorities
- No public artefact sharing
- Minimal hygiene moderation only

Primary relationship:
> *Learner ↔ work ↔ consequences*

---

### Post-Launch Expansion (Sequential, Not Parallel)

Introduce at most **one** new human role at a time, in this order:

1. Invisible hygiene moderation
2. Constraint-based peer artefact checks
3. Human verification for certification
4. Optional, paid coaching (late-stage)

Each addition must survive a distortion audit.

---

## Distortion Audit (Operational Test)

Before introducing any secondary role, ask:

> *Does this increase the learner’s reliance on external approval?*

If yes, reject or redesign.

If uncertain, delay.

---

## Final Position (Refined)

BMAD training should feel:
- Slightly uncomfortable
- Structurally supportive
- Socially quiet

This is intentional.

Judgement does not develop in crowds.
It develops where responsibility cannot be deferred.

---

*This refined document should act as a guardrail against premature community features, authority creep, and reassurance-driven design choices as the BMAD v6 Training Programme evolves.*
